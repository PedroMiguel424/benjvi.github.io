Comprehensible Input: How I stopped worrying and (finally) learned some Spanish 

My Story
 
  I have a long and storied history with the Spanish language. Over the course of my life I have had many interactions with the Spanish language. When I was a little boy we would usually take our holidays in Spain. The reason being, my aunt moved to Spain many years ago and married a Spaniard. So naturally all my cousins are Spanish, and although they speak English now, Spanish is very their primary tongue.

  So from those trips I did learn some basic words - mostly basic nouns, things they would call each other or objects around the house or garden. I also had a picture book, which I loved, which had pictures of similarly basic things you might encounter. As kids we could have some fun with our limited vocabulary. But I never learned more than these basics. After we would return from our holidays we would largely forget about Spanish.

  Fast forward a few years and I was in college. (My school mandated taking one language but did not ordinarily offer Spanish, so I studied French instead). I don't even remember for what reason I became interested again, but for some reason I decided to do a Spanish class. I studied for two terms and following that I even stayed in Spain for a week on a language programme. The course followed a standard  curriculum, involving plenty of grammar constructions and vocabulary. Of course, we also practiced speaking a lot and listening exercises as well.

  Looking back at that time from a few years later I recall very few of the things I learned. We learned a greater number of things than we did while I was a kid. However, without that learning linked to really memorable things or just in general, something that is really 'real', the language just did not stick. Parenthetically - the language class may have been better in this regard, but one week is too short an amount of time to make a significant impact.

  Fast forward again, until now. The last couple of years I had the desire to explore Latin America, including Peru, Costa Rica and Honduras. For the purposes of this story, Honduras is the most important. While many people are used to gringo tourists in Peru and Costa Rica, this is not the case in Honduras. In some places communicating with people was difficult and, , this was at times frustrating. Ultimately this is what gave me the motivation to start again with Spanish.

  Having tried and failed before, albeit perhaps with less motivation, I didn't want to do the same thing. For some time I was hoping that continual exposure to the language would be enough. In the time at home I switched my preferred Netflix language to Spanish (with English subtitles. I also started watching a Youtube channel, "Easy Spanish"\*\* in which they shoot short videos asking people on the streets of MExico city to answer basic (yet sometimes profound) questions about their life.  

  The idea was to incorporate the language into mt normal routine. And this worked quite well. By focussing on the interest that I had to watch the videos first, the habit stuck with me until now. However, in another way they are quite suboptimal. Because the majority of the dialogue is beyond my understanding (the truth on the name "Easy Spanish" is debatable), I only pick up simple words or phrases that are repeated a lot and often tune out the audio entirely and focus more just on the video and the English subtitles. Nevertheless, I should stress that I feel this has been helpful - with relatively little effort I have been able to keep my Spanish improving, albeit slowly.

  The missing piece is comprehensibility. By focussing more on phrases that you fundamentally understand but which contain an occassional new word, it is relatively easy to grok the meaning. With new verb tenses or constructions it is a bit harder but still possible to pick them up in this way. 

  ## What the idea of comprehensible input is

  In the field of learning models, the "comprehensible input" approach to learning says that simply by exposing learners to very slightly more of the language than they currently understand, they will come to understand the new pieces themselves by recognising the patterns and context in whats being communicated. It is also helpful in this process to provide as much context as possible, e.g. by miming or providing other visual aids.

  My experiences lead me to like this approach but there are some studies that have been done to compare different learning methods, including that of "comprehensible input". These studies seem to show that learners following the comprehensible input approach progress significantly faster than those using a more traditional approach (although both groups did still progress). [TODO: find citation for this]. 

  So we have an approach that hopefully you think is credeible. The other part of the learning puzzle is how you - as a learner - actively continue to commit to the learning process. You need to have some motivation. You probably intend to achieve something by learning a language - e.g. to be able to learn more about different cultures, to communicate better with specific people, etc. So that concerns your expectations for the future, but what is also important is the present - finding activities involving the languiage you want to learn that are enjoyable **right now**. If the process of learning isn;t enjoyable, its going to take a lot of willpower to continue for a potential future payoff. Life is just easier when enjoying what you're doing right now matches with your goals for future.

  ## Comparison to Other Language Learning Advice

  Probably the piece of advice I've seen the most often is that just getting yourself in the position to talk is the most important thing. THis advice is not the worst, put it does have some limitations. In the early stages of learning, your ability to converse is limited and your conversation partner needs to be willing and able to talk to your on your level. A conversation partner that understands your level and responds appropriately is the most natural form of getting comprehensible input. In one TED talk I watched, they refer to this partner as your 'language mother' which is a nice metaphor. It is suggestive of the level of trust and comfort that is required to learn a language well.

  Tangentially, some of the language advice I see seems to veer subtly and unhelpfully into the self-help realm: Go out there and talk to people! Get more confident in conversations! Immerse yourself in the unfamiliar and the novel and let go! These kinds of advices might work well for extroverts but it is unhelpful for more sensitive or introverted types. The fact is, you have to find the kinds of scenarios that work for you, where you're comfortable and getting the right stimuli to learn. You don't necessarily have to be comfortable in every situation.  

  Similar logic also applies to finding native speakers, or going to be 'immersed' in a country. It can work! Certainly immersing yourself in a country should provide your with lots of input, and at least a small portion of that is likely to be comprehensible. However, your interacts with native speakers  are likely to be short and relatively frustrating as a beginner. It takes a lot of patience, empathy and effort for them to sustain a dialogue at a level that's useful for you.  

  ## How I've been doing it

  Until now while learning I've been following what seem to be common practices: I have been using materials that sounds like they are designed to be for some one around my level, but I have also been trying to find some children's books that I can underestand and that can hold my interest. So far, I have started with "El Principito", which seems to be working pretty well.

  ### Raading vs listening

  I think there are two main drawbacks to using books to learn rather than audiobooks:
  - You will not become familiar with the phonemes in your target language. You will continue to rely on sounds you already know when you subvocalise the words when you are reading, so this not help your speaking and listening.
  - It is possible to brute-force your way through a book; sto work methodically thoguh each sentence transalating all the words and constructions you understand. This is tempting because it allows you to read books that you are most interested in in your target language. And while you are doing it, it feels like work; it feels useful. But from this its very hard to build up the flow of the language, it doesn't help get the foundations in place and build upon them. Instead you get this unsorted firehose of information where its hard to join the dots into a coherent whole. I've spent a while doing this and I wouldn't advise other people to go through this.

  Nevertheless, listening to an audiotrack is normally harder than reading the equivalent text on a page. So it may make sense to start with reading if the text you have is more complicated. This doesn't need to be an either-or.
