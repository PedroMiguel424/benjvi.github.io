THere are some books that see, to flaot into your life for no particular reason, and which end up burrowing deeply into your psyche. You have no particular attachment to the subject matter, nor has it become especially popular or well-renouned, but something compels you to pcik them up. *Never split the difference* by Chris Voss is one such book. Its click baity title doesn't especially set it up to stand out from other business-y type books, but it does manage to touch something deeper.

In a vague, liminal sort of way, I've been noticing over the last year or two htat there are two different types of people when it comes to negociation. There are people who see negotiation as a necessary evil to get things done when interests conflict. This conflict makes us anxious, and so we struggle to engage and often are avoidant. THe problem is, negotiation is not something that is avoidable - its not just for FBI negotiors (like Chriss Voss), salesmen or In my job, I often have disagreements about the best way to do a design - what will make a piece of software behave more coherently, or whether a particular test is important for describing a piece of functionality or is simply redundant. This is an exchange of inormation, but it is also a negotiation between two people with different values. Results have sometimes suffered whenever I have thought that such conflicts could be resolved by a thorough explanation of what I am right.

But there are another set of people who don't have the same set of issues. These people are just more OK with expressing their own wants. They tend to accept the differences between people and are OK with them. In fact, they focus more on other people regardless of whether they're different or not. When we're OK with the differences between people, seeing a negotiation as a process of discovery allows us to feel a collaborative bond with our counterpart. In fact, a well-conducted negotiation can bring two parties together. This doesn't even depend on whether the reslt is "equitable"[0], what is important is just that one party doesn't feel like they've been cheated or disrespected.

Chris Voss's book engages with negotiation on this emotional level, as a profound activity that everyone benefits from engaging with. He kind of eviscerates that "classic" of negotiation, "Getting to Yes" as completely misguided, based as it is in negotiation as a rational activity by which two parties enagage in a selfish exchange which ultimately maximises their individual utility functions.

His approach is titled, "Tactical Empathy", which seems to be identical to normal empathy, except that its motivated by tactical effectiveness (Even when he's not talking about it, you can always tell he worked for the FBI). Most of the substance of the book is fleshing this out into something more concrete:
 - Mirroring - physical and verbal. It shows you're paying attention to someone and is an important basis for empathy
 - Labelling/accussation audits - its helpful to throw out your hypotheses of what people are thinking, especially when its negative. People likek to be acknowledged and to be understood. And by throwing out the negatives, people are more likely to seek common ground, and say, "its not as bad as all that". This keep sboth parties focussed on reaching the common ground. And it is the unspoken fears that carry the most power, by getting them out into the open, their power can be diffused 
 -  Ushing for a "No" by asking a ridiculous question or mislabelling can be a powerful way to get someone to engage with you. Similarly, getting a "thats right" is often a breakthrough in understanding between two parties. It doesn't make sense to say this as social grease, or in seeking to appease the other, but just to affirm understanding.
 - An agreement means nothing without a means to carry it out. Asking questions like "How am I meant to do that?" engages your counterpart in solving your problems
