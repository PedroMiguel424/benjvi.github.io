Better to use frying potatoes - monalisa, kennebec - the more bland, the better
cut into almost equal sized pieces so they get a little more browned (golden) in some places than in others
you should put either put onions in to fry with the potatoes, or apart, but its better that they don't become coloured
cook with olive oil
cook in *a lot* of oil:
 - start with a soft heat ( medium low ). its good to add a lid so the top gets steamed a bit
 - after the potatoes are well poached, raise the temperature at the end to get the potato golden
 --- mash the potatoes a little bit with the spatula
the best way to add the salt is to add to the potatoes after they were fried
the best type of eggs are those where the printed code starts with 0 or 1 - this shows that the chicks ate in the fresh air (free range?)
proportion of egg to potato:
 - the potatoes should not be doughy, or floating in a sea of liquid, should be in the middle
 - good proportion is 1 large egg to 100g unpeeled potatoes
beat the eggs only a little so as not to accelerate the coagulation
drain well the oil from the potatoes and mix with the eggs and leave to rest for 3 minutes
--- thickness of the tortilla should be around 1 inch?
(still on high heat ?) cook the tortilla for 30 seconds before flipping it
then cook for another 30 seconds before flipping again
after 10 seconds more it is finished!

quantidades for a normal tortilla:
 - 3 patatas grandes
 - 1 ceblolla
 - 4 o 5 huevos
 - mucho aceite de oliva virgen extra
