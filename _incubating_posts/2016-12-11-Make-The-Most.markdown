### Planning in Advance - Adapt or Persevere?

For this trip to Australia, the plan was to do mostly usrfing, with some touristy bits thrown in. Research is important so I already knew that there are loads of beaches down the Great Ocean Road with heaps of well known breaks. Similarly around the Gold Coast and Byron Bay there should be plenty of opportunities for surfing. However, on my initial arrival into Melbourne, it was really cold and rainy. 

This doesn't need to stop you surfing. People have told me that they surf in all sorts of crazy places, like in New York winters. Wetsuits are pretty effective at keeping you warm. But, without the presence of the sun, the beach loses a lot of its appeal. Since I didn't book anything ahead of time, I was able to choose to go find hotter weather northwards. In general, although it may be good for the character to stick with things, its more fun on a holiday to have some backup options available. 

## Sometimes the best things are unexpected, sometimes the best things are in the gaps

My colleague Danielle recomended me that Springbrook National Park is a really nice place to go visit around the Gold Coast. And, indeed, that makes a really lovely hike. Like these two panoramas show, there is a pretty nice payoff for all the walking (and jogging, in my case). 

Surprisingly, though, the drive to and from the national park was equally enjoyable. The mountain roads and lack of traffic made for a great drive. The Great Ocean Road is famous as a roadtripping place, and arguably has better views, but because there is some traffic it is a little less fun for driving.

[what makes the difference in attending to stuff like this, or not?]

Similarly, a very memorable moment came when walking about in Byron Bay with some people from the hostel looking for a bar. A huge fork of lightning appeared, and spread out throughout the whole sky. In the midst of a fierce and unwelcome storm, this isn't something I'd have chosen but was truly an impressive moment. 

## Are you a completionist?

A few years ago I was going around Angkor Wat, you need to hire a guide who will take you around on a tuktuk, for either one or three days. Given the huge size of the temple sites, one day is clearly not enough time to even see all the highlights. so, the normal thing to do is to hire the guide for three days. Nevertheless, in the afternoon of the three days, sounding genuinely curious, he asked me why I was so interested in all the temples. He explained to me that after the first couple of days most people he guided and had enough and were just content to hang out in the town. 

In contrast, one of the best days I had recently was just lazing around the pool in the hostel, chatted to a few people and that was it! After a few days of intensive sight-seeing (or diving in this case) there comes a point where you hit a point of diminnishing returns. In the past I have been afraid to miss out on stuff, so therefore, would try and go and see everything. This sometimes lead me to feel a strange feeling. 

The feeling feels like you've done all the possible interesting things a place has to offer. Of course, this is not reflective of reality. At best, its reflective of your knowledge and connections. Relaxing and doing nothing is infinitely superior to this kind of feeling of exhaustion.

Now, I just try to make sure I hit the points I'm especially interested in.

Psychology may point to another reason for not overextending trips. Studies have shown that when we extend an experience but lessen its positive qualities during the extended period, the experience overall is remembered less positively. Of course, you are then trading off quality of memories against the quality of the experience in the momment.

## Being active and getting involved

Much of the appeal of travel is adventure. But, going to a new place, seeing the sights and eating the food will only get you so far. These are enjoyable but won't necessarily take you out of your comfort zone. Activities give a different way to engage with your surroundings. On the other hand, surroundings can be challenging and overwhelming, especially in less developed countries.  

Another kind of adventure is lead through o ther people. Meeting new people can be an adventure, it can be a chance to try out embryonic personae, or simply to get inspired by how other people live their lives. You can find out how you behave in different situations, with different groups of people. Each pereson has some ideas of what they want to do which tend to not be so different from what you want to do yourself.

On the other hand, sometimes the people you meet are difficult to relate to and relax with. Its always important not to force things and its always OK to take some time to retreat and relax when people throw you off-centre. Similarly some types of activities are not available to everyone. Going on a diving liverabord at the Great Barrier Reef would have been extremely intense had I not already done some PADI diving certs.
