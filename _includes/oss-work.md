## Open-Source Work

Although most of my work is closed-source, I have had the opportunity to work on open-source projects a few times. Some of that work is listed here:

* __Hoverfly__ - [Hoverfly](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly) is an open-source tool for service virtualization - allowing integration tests to be performed using simulations of services' dependencies. I [was involved as a core contributor to the project](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/commits?author=benjvi) during 2016.
* __Terraform providers__ - I have been involved in Terraform provider development on a number of occasions. Most significantly [in preparing the Cloudflare Terraform provider for its v1 release](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/commits?author=benjvi). The features in the new release were promoted on the Cloudflare blog [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/getting-started-with-terraform-and-cloudflare-part-1/) and [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/getting-started-with-terraform-and-cloudflare-part-2/). I also previously [contributed to the Cloudstack provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-cloudstack/commits?author=benjvi) and I have created a provider from scratch, [an MVP for a PKS provider](https://github.com/benjvi/terraform-provider-pks) which allows Terraform-based management of the product now known as VMware TKGi.
* __Humio Kubernetes Integration__ - I started [this repo](https://github.com/humio/kubernetes2humio) which sets up log and event forwarding from a Kubernetes cluster into the Humio log management system. [This blog post](https://www.humio.com/whats-new/blog/logging-with-kubernetes-and-humio) (or [this on Medium](https://medium.com/humio/logging-with-kubernetes-and-humio-30b087aaa539)) describes the outcomes the company was able to achieve based on my work. This work still lives on, somewhat reworked for fluent-bit and wrapped in a helm chart.
* __CD Pipeline References__ - I created [a reference pipeline for helm deployments](https://github.com/benjvi/helm-cd-pipeline) as part of some consulting work, for a startup bank that wanted to automate the upgrade process for platform components such as Prometheus running on Kubernetes. More recently, I created [another reference pipeline, with a GitOps design](https://github.com/benjvi/apps-gitops). In this case, I created a 'real' pipeline together with engineers from a client based on this template.
