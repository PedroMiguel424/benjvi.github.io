"begin with the end in mind" - stephen covey

 Effectiveness for a business theoretically means ability to decrease costs and increase revenue 
- In practice, businesses build their own ideology and worldviews and seek to maximise their own ideosyncratic metrics of business value
- An unexamined dedication to building quality software is subjugated to direct or indirect strategies to maximise business value
- From a [moral relativist](http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_relativism.html) POV this may be fine - [economic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)) and [consumer surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus) is presumably being produced by a business that remains a going concern (as well as producer surplus)
- But most people don't really subscribe to moral relativism. We want effect some good by what we do according to our own values
- Still up to us to decide what our values are. For me, it is some of the buddhist teachings that hold the most resonance. The actions that we take should encourage [expression of the four immeasurable states](http://www.viewonbuddhism.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html) and alleviate [suffering](http://www.lionsroar.com/deep-dukkha-part-2-the-three-kinds-of-suffering/). These concepts align cleanly with my experience, however, you may feel more comfortable expressing your terminal values in (e.g.) Christian terms or the more unambiguously secular formulations of ethics in philosophy. 
- What might we value as engineers? How do we connect the elegance of a well-conceived and well-engineered software systems to moral values like generosity, kindness and love?  
- Very often success is defined by the effectiveness of the system rather than its purpose 
  - System is built to replace something else, looking for greater efficiency 
- In DevOps we are typically constructing platforms for delivery and associated systems rather than products or platforms for external users
  - Centralised infrastructure provisioning with long turnaround cycles stymies autonomy and disempower peoples. It can cause alienation and even lead to conflict
  - Lack of feedback in the sfotware development process slows down learning and makes the process of developing software both less efficient and less enjoyable
  - We value flow and quick, learnable, composable software can encourage flow. Bloated, unintuitive and arbitary interfaces discourage flow
  - Useful software constructs are like mathemtics in that they are reusable. Jim simmons talks about this on Numberphile in the context of mathematics. A novel but seemingly useless new formulation in mathematics often turns out to have a useful application in the sciences.
 - Does enunciation of our values mean that we should do anything differently?
   - Focus on the truthiness of the ideas we seek to propagate
