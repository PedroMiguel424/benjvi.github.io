<strong>I’m a thinker</strong>. I love trying to figure out how things work. Especially the most personal of things. What do we want? What do we need? What makes us happy? What makes us suffer? And, what eats up our time? I believe a structured way of thinking can help us to address these issues. This meant I always loved learning, and I always loved reading, because this information gave me a framework to understand the world around me. And, I prefer to have a framework than to make blind guesses. But, not all understanding can be gained in books or in a class. It comes from a willingness to engage, a willingness to take account of new information, to try new techniques, and to continuously improve.

				<strong>I’m a technology person</strong>. Technology is simply the best way to improve people’s experiences. I love the opportunities that new tools open up. Disciplines like programming are extensions of mathematics, so by applying its data structures and algorithms to real people's problems you gain a precise understanding of those domains. When you see problems or possibilities, you have the power to change things! Like with all mathematics, each tool that you use maps best onto a different set of phenomena, and so the more that you learn, the more sides of a problem you come to understand.

				<strong>I believe in the power of quietness</strong>. I don't always need to talk a lot, or even need to be with people all the time. I will take a little time to think as well. I like to meditate, and to do yoga. I like art, and design, and nice things. I will reflect on people's experiences, and analyse how they intersect with my own. I believe that many of the actions we take by constantly rushing around are incoherent, and ultimately counter-productive. It is better to think a little first, and to take the right action.

				<strong>I don't believe in a singular narrative</strong>. I believe only in partial narratives, and in incomplete stories. Stories that we tell about ourselves, and about others are always post-hoc, and continuously changing. On each occasion we only choose to highlight the particular aspects of a situation that fit into a chosen narrative. Reality in its rawest form, stripped of all subjective theories, rationalisation and simplifications, has an almost infinite complexity. So, as much as I am able, I try to approach each day with a new perspective, because there is always a new way to engage with the same reality.

				<strong>I believe in the power of a single moment</strong>. The truth is, one moment can end up being more impactful than the months or years surrounding it. From my travels last year, the strongest memory is of two seconds: of looking over the edge of the Vercasza dam, and taking the leap into the void. The same feeling came when I first came onto stage as a freestyle dancer - being blinded by the stage lights, of knowing the audience is out there but not quite being able to see them. I remember just that moment - a pause, a moment of uncertainty - just before I took that fear and channeled it into my routine. These moments come on a more day-to-day level as well: when you are challenging a colleague, when you make a pitch, when you're standing up for something you believe in. These sorts of moments present a challenge, and taken rightly that grants you an excitement, an energy, to take hold of and thrive on.
