In the piece I'm going to talk about my experience, about how  I have grappled like many other people with a sense of dissatisfsaction that lingered just beyond by concious mind, and also I will internd to tyalk about how it is posssible to be your own worste enemy without even realizing it, and while ratiopnalizing this relationship to yourself as being something that is normal and an unavoidable part of life.

The majority of our experience is dominated by our instionctive reactions to things. In our essence, despite ouur capacity for intelliegenmce and logical reasoning, we are at our core still quite primitive creatures. The behaviour that drove our behaviour when we were still monkeyts is still present and thatw machinery is still useful in many situations [example here maybe]. [Someone] talks about an elephant with a rider on top - the elephant is the subconious, instinctive, mind that does most of the wrok, and the concious mind can, at best, learn how to steer the elephant in a particular direction. According to the widely adopted scheme of fmaous psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the elephant is "system 1" and the rider "system 2".

I had a question on my trello borad of potential essays. It was, "How should I determine what is the right amound of social interaction?". The motivation being to avoid becoming withdrawn, reticent or aloof whilst still allowing time for myself to recharge after becoming overstimulated. I noticed that on some occasions there seemed to be some force driving me to retreat into a separate space, a place where to ideate and observe whats going on around me. One way of trying to answer this question is to refer to the introvert/extravert characteristics, kand as Susan Cain outliined in the great book "Quiet" there are some effective coping mechanisms those displaying more introverted tendencies can use.

It occurred to me quite recently there is another way of analysing the proper way to behave in situations like this. It centres around the experiencing of shame that might come when withdrawing in this way. When leaving a party early you could feel alienated and not one of the team. You might ask yourself, "What kind of person is it that wants to go home when people are having fun?". You start to second-guess yourself. Maybe you just like to withdraw and avoid connecting. Maybe other people feel like you do but just push on. Maybe there's something wrong with you. Or maybe there's something wrong with your friends. Yeah they suck. So boring! And irritating. They just dont get you at all. 

This scenario seems particular to struggles with introversion, but the experience of shame is universal. Sometimes we are not capable of the skillful actions that perhaps we aspire to. We feel there are patterns in our behaviour that are unsatisfactory. When we find ourselves in one of these patterns, what is out reaction? How do we feel and what do we say to ourselves when our inner elephant gets spooked or starts to rampage?

I like to make sense of this all by reference to the four sacred virtues in Buddhism (and other religions). I'm not quite sure whether this is all we should aspire to but at least this provides a compass. When expressing these emotions we are able to spread positivity to other people:

1. Loving-kindness
2. Compassion
3. Empathetic Joy
4. Equanimity

On the other hand when they shut down and we can start to look to others for our direction, that positivity breaks can down. Of course they can't give us what we're looking for. This time is when we get locked into a cycle of blame, anger and self-pity. It is all too easy to get locked into the inside view of our emotion and to go along with the inner turmoil. We reassure ourselves how right we are, how other people have wronged us, and so forth. Or, we might try to resist the reality, to deny that we've been thrown off, and battle to go on as before. Inevitably, we fail. We might go on but cracks are showing. There is now a discord between what we want to project and the inner reality. 

Neither of these things really seems helpful but fortunately there is a third way. The title of this piece has made a promise and after all this foreplay, we've now reached the point where that promise can be fulfilled. How exciting!

## Mindfulness 

A mindfulness practice is really important. Without awareness how can we react? There are in fact a couple of challenges here. First is to notice that you're off-centre. This sounds easy, but its not. We have quick and instincitve reactions, and in the moment its often not possible to change these. So it can be when we start to cool down slightly that we can become conscious of our state of arousal. Even this requires some work. 

The difference between mindfulness and the natural process of analyssing what weent wrong in a situation is difficult to untangle consciously, but the experience is very different. The natural reaction is to try to look at what went wrong in a situation. and what you should have done to fix it or to aavoid it. With mindfulness, above all you are aware of your state in the present moment. This may be helpful in solving social or relationship problems - if your energy is negative now then its reasonable to assume it was a contributor to the porblematic situation. But mindfulness in itself is only really a tool for attending to the present moment and accepting it as it is.

The practice of meditation is the best way to develop mindfulness. THe pattern you follow in meditation practice is the same one you need to apply in stressful situations in life. In the simplest forms of meditation [ like a vispaassaa (sp?) - breathign meditation / zazen ]you are taught to recognize stray thoughts that come into your mind, to accept their presence and to let them go.  

I've been practicing meditation for the last 2 uears and over that time I've found it I have much more self-awareness. Some days I had felt like things were just grey, whereas in reality I was probably spreading negative energy around. AS things have developed, sometimes life feels mich more like a roller coaster - I have more consciousness of the ups and downs and I can do more to react to them.

## Mantras

So when you are feeling down, and negative, what exactly is it that you are supposed to do? After all, awareness of your state of mind is one thing, but that doesn't necessarily change anything. And while we are accepting of things as they are, that doesn't mean that we don't want to learn and become more skillful in order to spread mmore positivity in the future. 

Mantras are one thing that I use to tackle this. I noticed that these are something that started to arise natirally after I started going to yoga classes. In classes, the teachers often tend to repeat phrases from a set of mantras. This seems to me an expression of the most authentic and useffil form of yoga. And gradually, outside of classes I found that the same set of phrases would sometimes come to mind whenever I needed them. Then I started to notice that other ideas I come across can be helpful in the same way.

when you;ve noticed you;ve ifallen into a negative frame of mind it can be helpful to think about what the same situation might look like using a differeent mode of thinking. THis is where mantras come in. Mantras are set phrases embodying some considered, practiced, and skillful patterns of thought. They can help you to reroute a negatively-directed train of thought. Again, practice is required. Mantras carrry with them a feeling, and in order to be truly effective the mantra should trigger that feeling to embody your conscious thoughts. System 1 is stronger than system 2, after all. 

One mantra I use is "discomfort brings the possibility to find new space". When I have an aversive emotional reaction, this can calm me down and allow me to reconsider whats going on right now. this can help me to stay with something challenging, despite the discomfort. And this embodies a profound truth that resonates with me: we perform uncomfortable actions in the hope that there will be a qualitative change in our experience. With the right actions, these do happen.

For other situations there are different mantras, which ohopefilly correspond to a skillful waty of approaching the situation. A few other mantras I like are:
- "Emotions aren't infectious, there's no need to run away when you sense negative emotions"
- "The difference between strong and weak social networks is based simply on whether you think you belong or not"
- 

## Bringing it all together

It's hard to break out of negative reactinos to what life throws at us, but attedning to emotions and the present moment can be really helpful. PRactice in a safe space can be really helpkful to ingrain patterns that we can make use of when we're under more stress. Due to the importance of system 1 its not really possible to reason ourselves out of an unskillful train of thought. Instead we have to learn how to talk to ourselves in more positive ways, and to learn to cultivate emotional states that are full of kindness, joy, compassion and even-handedness.
