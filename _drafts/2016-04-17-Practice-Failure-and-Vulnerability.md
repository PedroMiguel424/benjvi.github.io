At the start of this year, I made some yew year's resolutions. It was important for me to make them measurable in order to test whether I've been successful or not in some kind of objective way. Being one third of the way into the year now I have enough data to make some preliminary reflections on how successful I've been, and whether these resolutions were the right resolutions.

## Life As Practice

My resolutions reflected the type of practice I want to follow in my everyday life. There are a number of different frameworks to choose from (the Buddhist dhamma always had the most resonance for me) but I want to keep this really simple and easy to keep track of. So in my scheme, there are three main components:

1. Social Practice / Connection

Whether I consciously show up for activities that require me to make some connection to other people. Either new relationships or strengthening existing relationships, doesn't matter - as long as I am not just drawing down on exissting relationships.

2. Spiritual Practice

I meditate to (1) swim in the feeling of lovingkindness, and to bring that feeling to my actions and interactions. (2) be mindful, to be able to recognise emotions when then arise, and not to be attached to them.

3. Physical Practice

As physical creatures, its important that the body is healthy for the mind to be healthy. If the body atrophies, the mind atrophies. On the other hand treating the body well, engaging in natural exercise and movement, produces joy and freedom, and opens up the mind. Towards this purpose, I seek to do anything that exerts the body.

## Why?

For happiness, happiness is a collective project. It starts with the mindfulness of the individual and radiates outwards to others. It reflects and intensifies when it meets the same positive energy of another person.

## High Expectations

My target, at the start of this year, was to meditate every day, exercise on 75% of days and make some social commitment on 50% of days. Not measuring and so not knowing how much I have been doing this, I tried to set goals that would translate into a clear, qualitative, increase in my practice compared to the status quo.

As a result it is not that surprising that I have struggled to reach the targets I set. Nevertheless, I am happy with my commitment to the practice and that the trend is overall upward. It is weakly upward, but that's OK, don't expect change to always be easy. It's nice to fail against a high bar.

## Vulnerability

What I lack sometimes, which is something that a lot of people share, is an willingness to expose myself. Its kind of a funny thing, when you realize that you are actually different from moment to moment and exposing yourself doesn't mean being fixed into an immutable identity (how others individually see you is rather complex and I suppose a rather complex topic though). So exposing yourself is exposing how you are at that moment and being honest about that. 

This is also about perfectionism - its easy to speak up when you have a clear idea of what to say and how to say it. But what about when you don't? You feel some reaction, maybe you feel like its valid, worthwhile and even important, but its vague and you don't quite have a clarity in how to express it. Do you go ahead and say it anyway, and when the quite likely misunderstanding comes do you persevere and try to clarify, or do you keep it to yourself?

A good example for me has been with speaking French. I am at an intermediate stage - I understand the majority or most discussions when the spoken voices are clear and relatively slow (albeit I miss some words which can make the meaning opaque). But I struggle with the speaking. I am afraid to make mistakes in my sentence construction and I don't persevere when my meaning has become unclear. My housemates I speak French to also speak English, so this is a crutch that I over-use. If I instead spoke my (quite ugly) French all the time, then I would improve much faster, as I would have more practice and I would fail more

IS this something can can be measured and tracked or does it just fall under a meditation practice? THe ideas that I'm talkinng about here can largely be placed under the big banner of non-attachment and not-self. The idea is that the concepts that you think of as yourself, those enduring qualities / identity that you cling to you do not define you, they are not constant over your lifetime and they are not internal to you. THe point of this is, reflection on whether actions were positive and "right" is worthwhile, reflections on whether you are / what you are are not because the even insofar as we show some characteristic patterns of behaviour, those things are impermanent.
