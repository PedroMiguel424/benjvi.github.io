For my trip to Cambodia, I chose to fly into the town of Siem Reap, and base my trip around the temple complex at [Angkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor).

Despite having already seen a lot of temples in Japan, this was to be quite a different trip. The histories of the two countries could not be more different.

In Japan, I could experience the traditions of a single contiguous culture. In Cambodia, the story is that of a fallen empire, left to decay and be overgrown in the jungle. It's only in relatively recent times that the remains of this empire have begun to be brought back into the light and restored.

Nevertheless, this was an empire that lasted over a thousand years. In this area, multiple different capitals were built and thrived. Beyond the eponymous temple of [Angkor Wat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat) - the jewel in the crown of this complex - there are innumerous other breathtaking temples.

In my time staying in Siem Reap, I visited Angkor for a three day tour so I would have time to see "everything" without being too rushed. I'm a bit of a geek, and a completionist, so that worked perfectly for me. I liked that I could see some of the less popular temples in addition to the highlights. You could certainly get a good sense of the place in the one- or two-day tours as well though.

On the first day, I arrived around late morning, came to my hostel, bought my Angkor pass in Siem Reap and hired a tuktuk driver/guide to take me around the site.

I've heard of people trying to bike around Angkor but that sounds crazy - given the intense jungle heat and the size of the Angkor size, travel by tuktuk is the only reasonable option.

For reference, on satellite imagery the site looks something like this, with the sites of Angkor shrouded in jungle:

Note the size of the complex at Angkor compared to the sizes of the airport and the modern city of Siem Riep (the second largest in Cambodia) for some sense of scale.

Since Angkor Wat is better to see in the morning at sunrise, we drove past it on the first afternoon and into the main city, [Angkor Thom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Thom). We enter via the south gate, the best preserved of the main gates:

![](/img/asia/angkor/1-south-gate-2.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/1-south-gate-3.webp)

Angkor Thom is the main, most enduring, "city" here at Angkor. It's enormous, although most of it is jungle so you don't notice you're on a site that was once the massive capital city of an empire. We head to the centre first, to [Bayon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayon):

![](/img/asia/angkor/4-baphuon-5.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/2-bayon-1.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/2-bayon-2.webp)

Bayon is distinguished most by its set of smiling faces - from here at the geometrical centre, these faces look out in all directions over the city.

I'm also introduced here to the ornate details in the temples and some of the recurring motifs, such as the carvings of *Apsara* and *Devata* - divine nymphs - that adorn the walls

![](/img/asia/angkor/3-bayon-details-4.webp)

Since we're in the centre of the city, this is where there's the greatest density of temples. Just up the road is the colossal [Baphuon temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphuon):

![](/img/asia/angkor/4-baphuon-4.webp)

This stands next to the walls of the royal palace:

![](/img/asia/angkor/5-royal-palace-walls.webp)

Inside of this, we find the Phimeanakas temple:

![](/img/asia/angkor/6-phimeanakas.webp)

The exact location of the palace buildings themselves within this area is unknown. It's interesting that *all* the greatest and most durable monuments built by the various rulers during the history of Angkor were dedicated to religious purposes - and the residences of the rulers themselves have not survived.

In front of the palace is [the Terrace of the Elephants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_of_the_Elephants), a ceremonial platform:

![](/img/asia/angkor/7-terrace.webp)

This is named for its carvings of - you guessed it - elephants:

![](/img/asia/angkor/8-terrace-details-1.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/8-terrace-details-2.webp)

At the north end of this grand terrace, we come to the [Terrace of the Leper King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_of_the_Leper_King). This  statue depicts the Hindu god of death -  [Yama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yama "Yama").

![](/img/asia/angkor/9-terrace-of-the-leper-king.webp)

Having seen the main cluster of temples, we continue around the [*small circuit*](https://helloangkor.com/navigating-angkors-temples-the-small-circuit-the-grand-circuit-map-guide/) to [Ta Prohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Prohm):

![](/img/asia/angkor/10-ta-prohm-6.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/10-ta-prohm-7.webp)

This temple stands out for its unique feeling of being swallowed by the Jungle.

![](/img/asia/angkor/11-ta-prohm-jungle-4.webp)

Its also famous for featuring in the movie (and game) Tomb Raider - it is one of the most popular temples so be prepared for some crowds

![](/img/asia/angkor/12-ta-prohm-crowds-2.webp)

Finishing up the first day, there's enough time to stop at one smaller temple - [Prasat Kravan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasat_Kravan):

![](/img/asia/angkor/13-pasat-kravan-1.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/13-pasat-kravan-2.webp)

On the second day, most of the day was spent at Angkor Wat.

I got up early to see the sunrise, hurrying along with everyone else:

![](/img/asia/angkor/14-angkor-wat-morning-rush-1.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/14-angkor-wat-morning-rush-2.webp)

The view over the mirror pond was beautiful though, as well as making for a spectacular photograph.

![](/img/asia/angkor/15-angkor-wat-mirror.webp)

Of course, with such a popular attraction, the reality is not quite as tranquil the pictures would suggest:

![](/img/asia/angkor/16-angkor-wat-mirror-crowds.webp)

Still, I found the crowd to be relatively calm and respectful; this really didn't spoil the experience.

Inside the temple, there's a lot of different buildings to explore, with a lot of ornate details everywhere.

![](/img/asia/angkor/17-angkor-wat-details-2.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/17-angkor-wat-details-3.webp)

This temple is intended to be a physical representation of Mount Meru, the home of the gods in Hindu mythology. In fact, other Khmer temples also share this purpose as [*temple-mountains*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_architecture#Temple_mountain), but its Angkor Wat that takes this idea to its fullest extent.

Even without a full understanding of the mythology, its not hard to understand how this place would invoke a sense of divine wonder in the Khmer people.

![](/img/asia/angkor/18-angkor-wat-view-2.webp)

After Angkor Wat, it has to be said that it was harder for the subsequent temples I saw to stand out. Although there are a lot more temples that have their own unique charm and are worth exploring, I found that my motivation to take photos did decrease accordingly.

From the afternoon of the second day, [Preah Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preah_Khan) was a highlight. Its a big complex with many different buildings.

![](/img/asia/angkor/19-preah-khan-approach.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/19-preah-khan-wide.webp)

In fact, since it was so big and I'd had an early start, I returned the next day to do some more exploring.

![](/img/asia/angkor/19-preah-khan-close.webp)
![](/img/asia/angkor/19-preah-khan-building.webp)

On the other hand, [Neak Pean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neak_Pean), despite the somewhat similar-sounding name, was not a highlight. The appeal is meant to be that its surrounded by a lake, but the lake was dry during my visit.

![](/img/asia/angkor/20-neak-prean-1.webp)

Given the climate in Angkor Wat, I would imagine this is not an uncommon occurrence.

Although by this time I'd drained my batteries as a photographer, I also enjoyed my visits to the temples at [Bantay Kdei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banteay_Kdei) and [Ta Keo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Keo).

In between the temple visits, it was nice to get up close with some elephants.

![](/img/asia/angkor/21-elephants-1.webp)

I'm glad I didn't take a ride, I've since learned that this practice is considered to involve suffering for the animals.

The last visit - on day three - was to [Bakong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakong). This is situated well outside of the main, heavily-visited, group of temples at Angkor. It's found at the Rolous site, more than 10km to the east of Siem Reap.

[Preah Ko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preah_Ko), another temple in the group, is the oldest temple in the site:

![](/img/asia/angkor/22-preah-ko.webp)

I climbed up Bakong right at the end of the day:

It was a great way to enjoy the sunset and a memorable way to end my visit to Siem Reap and Angkor.
