[This post](https://medium.com/@saronyitbarek/i-dont-belong-in-tech-3d73d8fd6f34#.effwnj8k7) really struck a chord with me. There is this tension that occurs in tech that we're always trying to progress things, we are driven to keep up with best practices, and there is this expectation of continual learning. But, at the same time the newness is never really proven to be objectively better. We see something differen, and see that it can it's easy to pick up, and has advantages in simple scenarios, and we adopt it. On that basis we enthusiastically move to rework all our existing code. Compared to doing science, this can sometimes seem rather strange.

I wonder sometimes if we would do better to spend more effort to try and find a singular best way to solve a problem, and then reuse it everywhere. We do see this at the level of algorithms, and even with modules, but rarely at the level of architecture. Changing this seems difficult when we have different communities of programmers, with different skillsets and levels of skill, who only understand different languages. It doesn't help that even projects that seem very similar might have a single constraint (e.g. on performance) which means the design has to be completely different.

Another difficulty is due to the amorphous nature of the discipline. Similar to other sciences with a social component like psychology or economics, it is very difficult to really prove things. Even if metrics are drawn up and software projects are stringently evaluated, it would be extremely difficult to control for all the possible confounding variables. These might be things like the calibre of the engineers on the various teams, their level of engagement or motivation, and so on. It also seems likely that such measurements would tend to influence the results. Needless to say, such  experiments would also be fairly costly.

With these things in mind, I often struggle to know when it is right to advocate for a particular technology. It's good to get excited about things, but its also good to evaluate things stringently. With each technology there is always a risk of it being fundamentally limited in a way you haven't yet realized. The skillful thing is surely to give an honest evaluation of each technology you used and how it contributed to the project outcome. But people have self-serving biases, they suffer from cognitive dissonence, and it is very easy (and might be more beneficial for your image) to gently press your foot on the hype pedal.

There is probably no solution to this, its a personal judgement about what is valuable. Personally, I think there are too many people jumping gung-ho into new technologies and there are too many new frameworks. Some of this is - probably not intentionally - due to CV-driven and ego-driven development. Although it may get less attention overall it must be worthwhile to take more time and prove a smaller problem with a high degree of confidence, as scientists do in the hard sciences. The best talks, and the products and the best projects seem to share this idea.
