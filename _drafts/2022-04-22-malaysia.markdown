After finishing my diving fun in Koh Tao, I was to continue south into Malaysia.

After an interesting overnight ferry ride, through a lightning storm, down to Surat Thani, I eventually found myself a bus transfer down to the border. All of this was a very surreal, dream-like experience, although now I only remember it very hazily. From there my bus journey continued to the first port of call in Georgetown, on the island on Penang.

Now, the city has does have a lot to offer. But, for me, what really made this destination truly memorable was the food, and that's what I'll focus on. Above all, for me, Malaysia is a foodie heaven. I would be quite happy to just wander through the streets, in the humid heat, just going from meal to meal all day long.

Because of that, this is one of the few times when I regret living in the moment too much, and therefore not taking too many photos of the food I ate. At that time in life I just hadn't developed the compulsive need to take photos of all novel food that I have today.

Malaysian food is a very interesting mix of different tastes and styles of food, coming from different cuisines. The main influences being from the large Chinese and Indian populations, that complement and enrich the indigenous Malay dishes and each other.

I headed to the nearby New Line Hawker city, and was overwhelmed by the number of sellers selling different dishes. Although I had made a few Malaysian friends at Uni, and tried a few things, I was really in over my head with all the different noodle dishes, soups, rice dishes and all the rest that I had no idea what it was. More difficult was that everything looked delicious, making it almost impossible to choose.

Although I have my favourite savoury Malaysian dishes, foremost amongst them the Char Kway Teow (fried noodle dish), perhaps the one dish that stuck out in my mind from this trip was a dessert: Cendol. Compared to the ice kachang pictured below from later in my trip, which is a very similar dish, it has a little less shaved ice and comes slightly melted, its a bit more of a soupy experience. It typically has more toppings than what's shown here and - crucially - worm-shaped, green, pandan-flavoured jellies.

I only spent one night in Penang, since my university friend Aaron had kindly agreed to host me at his house in the capital Kuala Lumpur (KL).

This was very good luck on my part, as not only did he take me to many different restaurants each day, but it also meant that I had some idea of what I was eating.

As just mentioned, my single favorite food is probably the Char Kway Teow (pictured), which is XXXX (TODO). This is also a typical Hawker scene in KL. It seemed to be less common that all the hawkers are out in the street like in Bangkok, and more common to have somewhat the same stalls in a more controlled, sanitised environment. It doesn't sound as iconic, but I found that those centres maintain the same bustling vibe.

For fried noodle dishes, hokkien mee (TODO: description) or mee goreng (TODO: description) are also popular and delicious options.

The noodle soups are also delicious. Pictured here is a delicious noodle soup that I have no idea what it is, but seems most likely to be a Pan Mee or something similar to that.

When it comes to noodle soups, the Laksa reigns supreme. Or, I should say, the Laksas, because there are many different types available. Laksas are a kind of fusion of south east asian curries with chinese noodle soup. The most popular, and also my go-to, was the curry laksa which is has a red curry and coconut broth. Many different meats can be used as ingredients, but the most common ingredients seem to be tofu, shrimps and beansprouts.

After a day or two of mostly just stuffing myself with food, I thought that I should do some sightseeing too. I found it hard to ascertain the centre of gravity of KL, but my best guess as the centre is the area around Merdeka ("independence") square, which is a pleasing mix of old and new, in the midst of skyscrapers but with many traditional buildings around. The neo-moorish or mughal architectural styles seemed to be common amongst those more traditional buildings.

After some time walking around outside, its time to escape from the sweltering heat in one of the many malls around the city. Despite being icy cold inside, unlike in many other places the mall is also a great place to eat.

So what else is unmissable and omnipresent? First and foremost, that has to be "Nasi Lemak", the prototypical Malay food and the national dish. It's a rice dish, served with a sambal spicy paste, boiled egg, ikan bilis (fried dried anchoves) and roasted peanuts. I always had them with a rendang curry on the side, which is another delicious dish. Other versions come with fried chicken, and could be with many other things.

More simply, you can have a roti canai, an indian-derived dish consisting of a paratha-style flatbread with a curry sauce. Can look rather basic but one of my faves.

![](/img/asia/malaysia/9-roti-after.webp)

There's also a whole range of indian restaurants and hawkers around where you can have access to other deliciousness such as a banana leaf platter, or in fact the whole gamut of indian dishes.

For that matter, we didn't scratch the surface of the Chinese food available either, but that's perhaps a topic best saved for another time. I will just mention my favourite typical malaysian chinese dish, Hainanese chicken rice, which looks very plain but is delicious, being slow-cooked in a broth that's then served on the chicken and rice.

Finally, the topic of desserts. As a tropical country, tropical fruits abound - mango, guava, dragonfruit, rambutan, starfruit. All make for delicious options in a dessert. But the standout malaysian fruit - that you have to try at least once - is the infamous durian. Because of its overwhelming odour, this can be an intimdating proposition. I found that a durian-flavoured ice cream, or something similar (it can be found in almost anything), was a gentle introduction to the strong aromatics of that fruit. It has to be said, its not for everyone, but I loved it!

Despite being lost in this food paradise, the travel continued. I visited the beautiful Batu Caves just outside KL, which are an important Hindu sacret site - although very hectic!

And Singapore is only a few hours down south, and definitely well worth a short visit. It's not a backpacker style place - too developed and not with any standout tourist attractions - but I had fun wandering around and appreciating the set pieces of the city.

Cuisine-wise, things are not much different than in Malaysia. Accordingly, I had a great time at the chinatown street (night) market around the corner from my Hostel.

Around the next corner was a similarly enjoyable hawker centre, just up the street from this beautifully ornate Hindu temple:

I only passed a couple of days in Singapore, which was enough to enjoy the city.

After that, I returned to my home base of KL. In fact, KL would be my home base throughout my backpacking trip, as its a hub for low-cost flights. 

![](/img/asia/malaysia/2.5-pano-2.webp)

It worked great as a hub, as I was always returning to delicious food and friendly faces.

In any case, I took advantage of those low-cost flights to get to the next destination, the furthest I would go on this trip, the land of the rising sun, Japan.
