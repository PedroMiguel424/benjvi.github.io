Books whose ideas have stuck with me. Books that I think would be worthwhile to read again. Books that I would like to write about. 

# Tech books

Designing Data Intensive Applications

7 Concurrency Models in 7 weeks - The first book I encountered in the "7 XX in 7 weeks" series and still the only one I worked through in its entirety

Site Reliability Engineering 

Learn You A Haskell for Great Good - A gentle and entertaining introduction to the daunting world of Haskell programming. If only there were more books like this for intermediate Haskell programming, and less blog posts about why monads are like, or not like, a burrito

Threat Modelling (?)

Java Concurrency in Practice (?)

# Tech/Business

The Phoenix Project - In the tech/business category. Essential reading if you want to understand the aspirations of Enterprise DevOps. And a good read

The Lean Startup - 

The Innovator's Dilemma - When people talk about disruption, this is (/should be) what they're talking about. Its an interesting lens through which to view innovation


# Spiritual and Buddhist Books

Happiness (?) - by Mattieu Ricard

Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

The Red Book

Moon in a Dewdrop

Domain Driven Design Distilled

# Anti-Recommendations

Books you may see recommended a lot but didn't work for me, or I would no longer recommend:

Design Patterns (GoF book) - I have read and referenced this a lot, especially when I first started programming in Java. However, functional languages and features are becoming more widespread, which makes many of these patterns either obselete or trivial. There are still one or two valuable things in here though.

Business Value
