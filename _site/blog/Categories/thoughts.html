				<h2><a href="/blog//2015/01/31/The-Blue-Pill-Or-The-Red-Pill">The Blue Pill or the Red Pill</a></h2>
				<p><p>
Many people like to travel, myself included, and if travel has to be just one thing, it is adventure. Most people would agree that travel is a type of adventure. But, how is it adventurous? We all have googles, tripadvisors and lonely planets falling out of our eyeballs. We know in advance exactly what we want to do and when we want to do it. Is that really adventure? On the other hand, if we take a trip that is unstructured and unplanned, we tend not to stumble across those amazing things we were hoping to find (although perhaps sometimes we do). So, where is the adventure to be found?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First things first, we have to decide what we mean by adventure. It turns out that the adventure has a strong structure, consistent throughout the accounts we have recorded through history in literature and the arts [1]. As narratives, these give us nice and simplified, but overall still somehow truthful, prototypical adventures. In each, the first act is first some kind of trigger, or "call to adventure". The protagonist (adventurer) must accept this call, or at least be somehow bundled along by it (think of Alice falling down the rabbit hole). The main part of the story is the experiences that the adventurer must go through once they have crossed the threshold. Once they have left their mundane everyday existence, they enter into a different world - we are talking about an entirely different psychic world here. From this point forward they experience only unfamiliar experiences. They are entirely disconnected from what was before. They must take some risks and they must face some challenges, whose nature may vary widely. These challenges may or may not entail some suffering, but it <em>is</em> crucial that the adventurer must be forced to call on some hidden resources (e.g. of strength/resourcefulness/guile). When the adventure has ended (as adventures must) the adventurer must return to the "normal" world. But this is not the same world that they had left behind. Our adventurer's psychic world has shifted, and so must the real world shift to accommodate this.
</p>
<p>
From this analysis, some things immediately become clear. Adventure must originate externally. You cannot stay in your room all day and have an adventure. Sorry, but no, that is not possible. You can learn, you can relate, you can even self-actualize, but you do not adventure. Of course it is possible for a call to adventure to be incubated here, but it must eventually go further. Activities like creative pursuits (writing, painting) or meditating can be very productive and very expansive, but they are not adventures. They either rely on introspection or upon our previous experiences. So, that's the first thing to be clear about, adventures are from the external world.
</p>
<p>
Second thing, adventures are not forced upon you. There is always the possibility to refuse the call or to be blind to the possibilities. There are many little things in life that are calls: random topics that come up in conversation, new people that join you at work, something interesting you read about in a magazine. All these things can be seen as rabbit holes of indeterminate depth. You must first be open to recognizing these for what they are - <em>possibilities</em> - even if more often than not, they are not very deep at all.
</p>
<p>
With this in mind, we can return to the original question: of where adventure is to be found. We have come to the rather unsatisfying answer that it can be found anywhere. More precisely - it manifests itself any time that some stimulus leads you out of the quotidien and into something new. This doesn't have to involve any travel at all; the sport of parkour is a nice example of how a existing cityscape can be morphed and remoulded to serve a new perspective.
</p>
<p>
So then why the association of travel with adventure? Well, travel may bring us to the unfamiliar and to the unknown. Travellers have open minds and are searching for something new. At the very least, travel removes us from the everyday. But in itself it may not be sufficient to move us to a different mental plane; we understand now that adventure is something a little more elusive. Best is to follow your existing interests, bring yourself into contact with open-minded people, and keep your eyes open to the call.
</p>
<p>

[1] I have read an excellent book which tells more about the commonalities of our story structures - The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories, by Christopher Booker. Highly recommended.

				<h2><a href="/blog//2015/01/03/New-Years-Substitutions">New Years' Substitutions</a></h2>
				<p><p>
As I have been learning a lot about psychology this year, I thought to make some changes to my New Years' Resolutions. Specifically, for the bad habits I want to cut down on, I will now rely on <em>substitution</em>.
</p>
<p>
Substitution, as a strategy for habit change, is based on a psychological theory of behaviours. The first thing this says that the behaviour can be broken down into a trigger, a routine and a reward:
<ul>
	<li>The <em>trigger</em> includes both the context and the specific prompt for the behaviour</li>
	<li>The <em>routine</em> describes the sequence of physical actions and the though processes being carried out in the behaviour</li>
	<li>The <em>reward</em> specifies which results of the behaviour stimulate any of the various reward centres of the brain [1]</li>
</ul>
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Keeping this in mind, we now turn to the dual process theory [2]. This says, again in brief, that most day-to-day decisions are made by "System 1", which responds to incentives simply, quickly and largely subconsciously. It is the other system, "System 2" with which we actually make resolutions. This system follows (relatively slowly) a chain of reasoning to arrive at a rational conclusion. So, we have the situation where we tend to formulate our strategies according to the processes and preferences of System 2, whereas it will be the instinctive System 1 that actually carries them out.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, in our deliberations (System 2) we must always seek to make more efforts to come up with an approach to change that will also work for System 1. In the case of behaviours we want to get rid of, this means making substitutions. And more precisely, this means looking for new behaviours that will reward us in the same ways as our current behaviours - but without the negative effects associated with them.
</p>
<p>
To get a bit more concrete, one habit [3] that I want to modify for 2015 is my TV-watching behaviour, which I feel is sometimes too extensive and a bit of a time sink. More specifically, I regret watching shows which I am already familiar with and which are essentially always the same. The process of breaking this down will also be a good way to illustrate substitution in practice.
</p>
<h2>Behaviour Change: TV-Watching</h2>
<p>
The literature suggests [4] that a primary motivation to watch television is a desire to relax. And, indeed, TV is generally successful in sating this desire. Interestingly, what also comes with the relaxing effect of television is a certain amount of arousal - the extent of which depends on the specific programming. Hence it has been suggested that TV watching can be used in a variety of ways to regulate mental states in different ways [5].
</p>
<p>
This accords with my own experience. My primary time for TV-watching is after work, at which time I am carrying a moderate amount of generalized stress, some cognitive fatigue, and perhaps some ideas to address outstanding work problems may be bouncing around in my head. With this simple realization, we have enough information to nail down a specific behavioural pattern:
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Reward: </strong></em>Let go of stresses<br/>
<strong><em>Routine: </strong></em>Make dinner then watch TV<br/>
<strong><em>Prompt: </strong></em>Coming home from work, tiredness
</p>
<p>
With this made clear, it is possible to start thinking about substitutions. There are indeed many ways to let go of stresses but when we analyse it we will see that few are quite as flexible as watching television is. However, not all is lost; we still have some possibilities:
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>Meditation</h4>
		<em>Pros: </em>Extremely effective relaxation technique<br/>
		<em>Cons: </em>Can be difficult if too tired, and difficult to tie into system 1 as the benefits are subtle. Not that time consuming (or is that a positive..?)
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Exercise (Gym/Running)</h4>
		<em>Pros: </em>Good to dispel thoughts, healthy activity too!<br/>
		<em>Cons: </em>Not always feasible due to injuries/bodily fatigue
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Reviewing Ideas or Writings</h4>
		<em>Pros: </em>Could be a good, low-energy way to engage creatively, and to be drawn into a different realm of ideas<br/>
		<em>Cons: </em>Depends on having some creative output and in those having remaining loose ends to latch onto
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Cooking</h4>
		<em>Pros: </em>Engaging and creative activity, so long as the dish is not second-nature or just trivial. You need to eat to live, so some kind of cooking must be done anyway<br/>
		<em>Cons: </em>Dependent on having something (relatively) new that you want to cook
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Random Browsing</h4>
		<em>Pros: </em>Amply distracting, find some interesting ideas<br/>
		<em>Cons: </em>Not optimally relaxing, easy for worries to intrude, similar to the aspect of TV I have a problem with in that <em>some</em> genres of article come up repeatedly without carrying any thought I haven't seen before (N.B. I also want to do a little less of this activity)
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This was just a very idiosyncratically-chosen list, of the activities that are most salient to me personally. There are many more possibilities than this. But hopefully the commonalities between the activities are clear, in that they are all motivated by the same desire. And hopefully, it is clear that while each is not as flexible as TV watching, in aggregate they do become as flexible - for while one might not always be feasible, another will be. 
</p>
<p>
As always, the proof is in the pudding, and it is no different for this concept of substitution. However, this general approach - of decomposing activities and addressing their motivations - seems to have great promise.

	<li>
	Primarily the Dopamine System, also see other brain areas such as the Nucleus Accumbens or the Anterior Cingulate Cortex
	</li>
	<li>
	Described in great detail and lucidity by the pre-eminent psychologist, Daniel Kahneman in "Thinking, Fast and Slow"
	</li>
	<li>
	A point we have not addressed until now - what precisely is a habit, beyond our intuitive understanding? This is a bit of a diversion here, but my first pass would be "a self-contained endogeneous behaviour that manifests consistently in a particular context" 
	</li>
	<li>
	See (eg) Henning + Vorderer (2001); M Csikszentmihalyi, R Kubey (1981); AM Rubin (1983, 1984) D Ferguson, E Perse (200). Unfortunately there is not much consistency in terminology amongst the various motivations that are identified.
	</li>
	<li>
	I have not been able to uncover a consensus on which psychological needs motivate TV-watching, but the following three seem to have the most credence:
	<ol>
		<li>
		The need to down-regulate mental arousal (i.e. the need to de-stress).
		</li>
		<li>
		The need to up-regulate mental arousal (i.e. being bored and looking for stimulation).
		</li>
		<li>
		Avoidance of doing nothing (psychological escapism). This is the most phenomenologically interesting, as it says that for some people, being left with their own thoughts is unpleasant and an experience that they are driven to avoid. This is related to the traits of neuroticism and the Hardiness metric (as proposed by Maddi et al).
		</li>
	</ol>
	Of course, there are more reasons to watch TV beyond needs in mental/emotional state. We have not even mentioned how we may value TV as an art form...
	</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<em>
"The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>

<br/>

</blockquote>

</p>


<p>
What does Hedonism mean to you? Perhaps the first things that come to mind will be sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Or indeed, money, hoes and dro. This is surely a hedonistic way of living life. But is this, in fact, everything that hedonism can mean, and is hedonism an immature and irresponsible way to live life - suited best to rockstars and other self-destructive types?  
</p>


<!--more-->


<p>
I say no. Hedonism is a simple idea, and not at all limited to base and unworthy pleasures. It specifies one rule: the more pleasure, the better.[2] What constitutes pleasure is up to you to decide. It is not specified that pleasure now is more valuable than pleasure later, nor is it necessarily specified that one type of pleasure is better than another. One thing that it does say is that the moral qualities of a pleasure cannot be invoked to justify it being better than another [3]. Either it eventually produces more pleasure or it doesn't.  
</p>


<p>
The associations of a pleasure - with intellectualism, with culture, or indeed with depravity, are irrelevant. This is important, as we are often able to fool ourselves into thinking we like things for external reasons - such as to signal loyalty to a group, or to signal our own (self-perceived) qualities. In Freudian (psycho-analytical) terms, these are the actions of the super-ego. But, as we live in different times to Freud, we do not experience the same types of social judgements and self-censorship.  
</p>


<p>
We live in a post-modern world and that means that we no longer have the taboos and judgements of previous times. The values we are judged against are less specific and less numerous but no less demanding [4]. The primary directives we have now are to 'enjoy' and to 'be permissive'. Notions of duty are much less important; to get a good job, to find a nice partner, etc, are no longer specified as inherent goals but only as instrumental goals. More important is to enjoy yourself - to travel, to do everything in Time Out [5], to have many friends and perhaps many partners [6].  
</p>


<p>
None of these values are necessarily problematic by themselves. But it is how we react to them that is an issue. This permissiveness weighs on us as an obligation [7]. We are required to do these all things to make sure we are having a good time; we do not just do them because we want to do so but rather because this is what we must do to be living a 'good life'. And this leads back to the subject I initially wanted to address, which is how we go about judging the relevance of different types of pleasure in hedonism.  
</p>


<p>
The first thing we must acknowledge is that different people have different natures and therefore the value of a particular pleasure will have a different worth depending on the person. A physical object - a piece of cake, say - will always be experienced differently by different people. Each will see it with his own eyes, bring his own associations and will taste it differently (even if each is equally hungry). So we see there cannot be a perfect set of pleasures which are the 'highest' set, which everyone should try to engage in and eschew the rest. And by the same token, the sets of pleasures which are the most extreme, the most exotic, the most varied [8] too cannot be the 'best' set of pleasures.  
</p>


<p>
This is something I have really struggled with. There is this notion, a naive notion in fact, that a cake is more tasty than a carrot. So, it is only because cake is so unhealthy that people don't eat it all the time. But, this categorization of food is profoundly damaging. Because a carrot can also be enjoyable, given the right circumstances. I don't like even to say that one is more enjoyable than the other, because they are quite different types of pleasure. What I can say is that, for myself at least, there are many times when I would prefer to eat a carrot than a piece of cake. I don't choose to eat them because they're healthy, but because they taste good!
</p>


<p>
We can extend this and apply this same principle much much more widely. There exists this notion that some things are 'fun' and some things are 'good'. So if, for example, you will visit an art museum, people will assume that you do not do so as a hedonist but as a 'cultured person'. In other words you are a person that wishes to develop himself in some way - perhaps intellectually, culturally, or however else. And I say no! This is a more subtle sort of experience than a nightclub for sure - but this doesn't undermine it as an experience to be valued purely as a hedonist. 
</p>


<p>
This pleasure simply belongs to a different mode of hedonism - where the visual stimulation from the artworks is gratifying, as is the feeling of insight and stimulation of ideas that it engenders. Even if the ideas don't persist for long, and even if they never have any chance of going anywhere, it is irrelevant. It is quite possible just to enjoy the experience as a hedonist and there needs to be no larger purpose than that.  
</p>


<p></p>

<h4>Notes</h4>


<ol>
    <li>If you enjoy the motif of introducing an essay with a Hip Hop quote, then you absolutely should read Ben Horowitz's writing.</li>
    <li>This sometimes includes the proviso to respect the rights of others to do the same (see below). </li>
    <li>The relationship between self and other is a little more complicated in hedonism. We must position ourselves between two poles: as a selfish agent we should only provide pleasure to other in order that we can experience pleasure (and not harm) ourselves. The ethical (but not always achievable) position is that we should treat our pleasure as equal in importance to that of every other person. These are not so far away as they seem as bad actions give "bad karma" - mental stress and (generally) more likelihood of future suffering. However, there does exist here some measure of traditional morality that we can live up to or not. </li>
    <li>Because - although cultural values have changed, basic psychology has not changed. The super-ego/self-censoring function is as significant to the brain as it ever was. </li>
    <li>For the unknowing, Time Out is a free magazine that tells you about all the new restaurants, art, events and nightlife. </li>
    <li>But, still (perhaps) not <em>too</em> many partners. The point that is being made is that it is better to have too many than too few. </li>
    <li>This borrows some themes of the philosopher Slavoj Zizkek. For a starting point: 
    <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n17/fredric-jameson/first-impressions">one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjhhHpCAXHM">two</a>
    </li>
    <li>It is not at all clear to me that this adjective is even well-defined in this context. </li>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/04/07/Seven-A-Day">Seven-A-Day</a></h2>
				<p><p>According to a new study that has been doing the rounds in the news, the traditional 5-a-day doesn't really cut it and we should be eating 7 portions of fruit or veg every day. What's more, the majority of those portions should be vegetables rather than fruit. For a non-vegetable eating person like me, this certainly seems like a lot. But, the health and lifestyle benefits are scientifically proven, and we should all listen more to solid science. Some of the benefits of eating more fruit and vegetables are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lowering the risk over obesity/type 2 diabetes as vegetables are filling and not high in calories</li>
<li>Lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and some cancer</li>
<li>Keep you healthy and energised with vital vitamins and nutrients you need</li>
</ul>


<p>I certainly want to get on board with each of these benefits. But, I have a "pragmatic" approach to food - if it is quick, and tasty, that's what I tend to go for. And, I know many people are in the same boat with me. So, we will have to devise some kinds of strategies to get us eating more healthily - and being more healthy.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Step 1: Identify some vegetables that you love</h2>

<p><img src="/blog/img/asparagus.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/sauerkraut.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/blueberries.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/></p>

<p>Hopefully, this shouldn't be too hard. Vegetables are not all hateful. There are the lovely crunchy carrots we can eat as a snack, or tomatoes and onions, which form the basis of so many types of sauce or stew you might like to make. There is spinach, which is lovely with garlic and with eggs. Or cabbage, which is the national food of the Germans (in the form of <a href="http://thehealthyeatingsite.com/how-to-make-sauerkraut/">sauerkraut</a>), and for good reason. The Japanese also eat a lot of cabbage in the form of okonomiyaki, when they're not eating edamame or pickled ginger. And, there are many more. Really, this step of identifying what you like is vital to a sensible nutritional plan - as eating things you don't like everyday is unrealistic and, frankly unpleasant.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Add a little fruit to your breakfast</h2>

<p>Yes, you could go to town with an eggs florentine or even just put together a omelette with some spinach, but that just somehow never seems to happen in the morning. So, even if you are dashing straight out of the door and having a cereal bar on the way to work (I prefer a protein shake, myself) you can augment it with at least a piece of fruit.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Avoid buying lunch in a box</h2>

<p>Most of the common foods sold as convenience lunches have remarkably little vegetable content. Maybe you might find a little lettuce in a wrap, or if you're lucky perhaps some carrot, but that tends to be about it. If you do go for one of the salads, you'll probably be hungry and looking for anything to scoff down come mid-afternoon (I wonder, are these salads targeted solely at small women and desperate dieters?). If you spend a little more on lunch you might have more luck, but the best bet is to prepare your own food wherever possible.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Add some side vegetables to each meal</h2>

<p><img src="/blog/img/green-beans.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/carrots.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/edamame.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/></p>

<p>A typical main portion of a dish will tend to have around one portion of vegetables (tomato/onion/garlic etc..). For example, in a spaghetti bolognese you have some meat, some tomato in the sauce, and the spaghetti. So, with two main meals a day, that is not going to get you close enough to the target. You can add some green beans, carrots, or a side salad depending on how you feel, and depending on the meal. The more the better - feel liberated to experiment with swedes, radishes, asparagus and whatever weird and wonderful things you can think of.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Replace common staples with pulses or beans</h2>

<p>The bulk of a meal which typically comes in the form of bread, pasta, rice, or potatoes can sometimes be replaced, by beans or pulses. These are more healthy, and are allowed to contribute as only one of your seven-a-day. Where this replacement doesn't really work, for example with a chilli - my brother's excellent idea was to substitute with sweet potato instead. This also may count as just one of your seven-a-day.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Take a healthy snack instead of crisps or chocolate bars</h2>

<p>After following the previous steps, the instinct to eat inbetween meals should be weakening. Vegetables are made up of complex carbohydrates that take some time to be converted into sugars, and so energy is released for hours after you eat. Therefore, mid-afternoon hunger pangs foods like chocolate bars or crisps which sometimes seem satisfying (for about 10 minutes) should become a little rarer. But, not necessarily non-existant. So, instead of highly processed sugary foods, take something more refreshing such as an apple, or orange or some carrot sticks.</p>

<p>For hunger pangs that are beginning to bite, you can ward them off with more substantial like a trail mix. What I find really helps with trail mix is to make your own, including only those types of nuts that you actually want to eat. There are many filler foods that are added into pre-made mixes which aren't noticeably unpleasant, but they do make your food experience rather more mundane than it should be. For example, in almost all commercial nut mixes they add in walnuts and brasil nuts which I don't like, and which put me off everything else in the mix by their overwhelming boringness.</p>

<h2>Step 7: Mix things up - Colour is good...more colour is better</h2>

<p><img src="/blog/img/spinach.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/cherry-tomatoes.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/swede-soup.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/>
<img src="/blog/img/red-cabbage.jpg" style="max-height:200px"/></p>

<p>The natural thing to go for in a diet is variety. Its good to try different things: different flavours, different textures, different combinations. It stops you getting bored. Moreover, I believe that the body naturally craves for a variety of food, so that we consume all the different types of nutrients we need. We get iron from spinach, potassium from bananas, vitamin C from oranges. And the medical advice extends this idea. Since food with different colours contain different types of vitamins, they say that to improve our health, we should try to eat foods of all different types and different colours. This is a good philosophy - of variety, trying new things, of mix-and-match.</p>

<h2>And ... Enjoy!</h2>

<p>Really, its as simple as that. In general, the principle of making substitutions is an excellent one. You need to be realistic and to realise what it is that you actually want, rather than trying to deprive yourself. I've been following this regime for around a week now, and whilst it is too little time to notice any major changes, I have been enjoying my food so far.</p>

<p>Everyone has cravings for things sometimes, and it is how we direct those cravings, not their mere presence, that produces either a good or a bad outcome. And since we all want to be healthy and energetic, I think it is always worth trying to give yourself a little nudge to make you daily decisions just a little bit better.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/01/23/My-Little-Theory-About-Expansion">My Little Theory About Expansion</a></h2>
				<p><p>Sometimes nature is cold, and the chest heaves with shock  as we haul ourselves off to work. She is anti-social. But, she is pretty sometimes.<br/>
<img src="/blog/img/bbcsnow.jpg" alt="BBC snow" /></p>

<p>Even when she is destructive she is surprising. She threatens to break down our schemes and our ideals of law and order. Things may become less useful therein, but do they also become less attractive? And do we sometimes gain when things fall apart?</p>

<p>Quickly enough nature changes. Unpredictably, too. You need to take what you can now, because it might not be the same tomorrow. Moreover, you can take comfort, because even those aspects that annoy you will fade away as the zeitgeist is refreshed. Better, you should take a broader view, beyond what's comforting; comfort is not the best thing a person can have.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/doughnuts.jpg" alt="Doughnuts" /></p>

<p>The human body (and mind) has a remarkable ability to adapt itself, to acclimatise to circumstances. The first sip of a beer is always the best, equally the first bite of most foods the most memorable. This applies over a longer timescale too. Tastes evolve according to habit. After regularly eating spicy food, you can stomach more spice. Lots of mature cheese, you crave more mature cheeses. Lots of time spent with a disagreeable person, you begin to see their good side. Studies have suggested that even though wine enthusiasts can distinguish between wines better, they do not enjoy those wines any more than the average person. Indulging in luxury frequently removes the luxuriousness, and merely sets a new baseline of expectation. Better to keep some things as a treat to be enjoyed between friends.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/yauatcha.jpg" alt="Yauatcha" /></p>

<p>No matter how nice those nigiri may be, after a while would come cravings of a different colour. Cabbage perhaps, or spinach (yes, as strange as it sounds to some, I have laboured under a  craving for spinach on many occasions). This is also nature - she likes divergence, and change. Those that can't adapt to this change, like dinosaurs or dodos, die out.</p>

<p>Better not to single-mindedly pursue the perceived best, what one should do is to chase a wider range of stimuli. Nature, she gives us a variety even from day-to-day. Cold today, warm tomorrow. Dry today, rainy tomorrow. Windy today, still tomorrow.</p>

<p>Looking at overall trends, there may be advantages and disadvantages everywhere you go. In England it is usually too cold and rainy, but friends from Tropical countries have told me that the summer in England, when she emerges, is the perfect weather. But even this weather, if you start to exercise, can quickly start to seem oppressive. Hot, humid and tiring. And, don't forget to put the sunscreen on!  The point is, there is no one perfect thing to aim for.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/wimbledon.jpg" alt="Wimbledon" /></p>

<p>Similarly, we shouldn't talk of making ourselves better, but of expanding ourselves. Each person has explored some territory already through their experiences. This is not all physical territory, and the physical is not the important part of any exploration. We can explore in our own towns, or even without leaving the house. There is a whole landscape of ideas which also are an important part of the world despite their invisibility - those of psychology, programming, literature, economics, aesthetics,  mathematics,  and so on.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/ra.jpg" alt="Royal Academy" /></p>

<p>Of course some ideas are not so invisible. Ideas don't have to be academic. We can feel them, touch them see them and hear them. One can stimulate ideas through activity - through yoga, or meditation one becomes in touch with the body and mind. Or through drawing or painting. Similarly in different forms of exercise you explore the link with your own body. An experienced weightlifter has much more awareness of his posture, and of which muscles he is exerting when he lifts things. A seasoned runner has a reliable sense of his own cadence which the beginner lacks.</p>

<p>And some kinds of ideas just can't be categorised. They don't need to be either. They are just novel. Alien and yet familiar, they delight us. They do not give us a reason or a meaning, simply, because not everything needs one. We tend to regard this as the realm of the arts, but this isn't limited to galleries, or fairs, or pavilions. Surprising, and divergent ideas are all around us. Whether in various types of design, or often in rather less tangible forms.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/citizenm.jpg" alt="CitizenM" />
<img src="/blog/img/netherlandsbiennale.jpg" alt="Netherlandsv Pavilion at Biennale Venezia" /></p>

<p>It is at this point that we must make a little disagreement with mother nature. Sometimes, she tells us to be wary of the new, to stand back and to avoid things we are not familiar with. But, this does not apply in our man-made environment, for two reasons. Firstly, we have much more information available to us to be able to judge the risk of various unfamiliar things. Secondly, and more significantly, the environment which is shaped by man has a predisposition to exclude those things which are dangerous, and to include a plurality of gratifying things. If we stay within this realm, then we have much less to fear. Other people protect us - this is civilization.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/verzascadam.jpg" alt="Verzasca Dam Bungee" /></p>

<p>This principle goes even further. While we were traditionally tribal creatures, we are tribal creatures no longer. We are civilized creatures with tribal instincts. Most of us live in a land of abundance; we seek to fulfil ourselves through opening up more possibilities rather than by trying to fulfil our needs. We have all we need to sustain ourselves.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means people are less dangerous than our instincts may tell us. Most people are living in a secure situation and are predisposed to collaborate. So, yes, its okay to give your sincere output now. You don't lose by it. You give it and then observe what comes back. Where positive returns are received, you must commit to reinvesting. Where nothing or negativity comes back, you make the decision to close out your position. From the start, there's no risk, since it can in fact be easier to give than to withhold.</p>

<p>Following this resolution, one expands through first diversifying connections. Then we should filter based upon what works. We find that with some people, we can continue to expand. Like with some ideas, and some activities, we find each expansion brings more opportunities for linkages between people and ideas. This is freedom.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2013/04/10/Sakura">Sakura Falls</a></h2>
				<p><p> <img src="/blog/img/sakura.jpg" alt="Sakura falling by the Bamboo Forest in Kyoto" /></p>

<p>One year already since the last cherry blossoms fell.<br/>
In Japanese culture the cherry blossom (桜) tree is a symbol of the transience of life: it is made infinitely more beautiful by its fleeting nature.<br/>
This concept, somewhere between an aesthetic principle and a general philosophy, is known as wabi-sabi (侘寂).<br/>
With new life flourishing as spring proper begins, let us each recommit to living with vivaciousness, conviction and bravery.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2011/10/10/When-I-Saw-This-Book-I-Laughed">When I saw this book I laughed. But when I started to read...</a></h2>
				<p><p>"Made to stick" is a book about sticky ideas. It seems most relevant to marketers. But, the message that it conveys would be useful to anyone. Its all about story-telling, and who doesnt need to tell stories?<br/>
The authors advice: in order to communicate a message for maximum recall, we should not rely on facts or figures, but should instead tell stories. Even if not telling a story, we should include some story-like aspects, which are identified as the following:</p>

<h3>Simplicity - finding the core of the message. And making it compact.</h3>


<ul>
<li>"Its the economy, stupid" = What you remember from Bill Clintons presidential campaign. Even if you didnt see the campaign.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Unexpectedness</h3>


<ul>
<li>Get attention by breaking a pattern. Were good at recognising patterns, and dealing with them without giving them much attention. Break this system!</li>
<li>Create mystery; highlight a knowledge gap.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Concreteness - Minimise abstraction in factor of examples</h3>


<ul>
<li>Dont fall prey to the curse of knowledge. A successful story will naturally be an over-simplification. But people can only learn things one at a time.
The abstractions that an expert can deduce from experience will not be meaningful to someone without those experiences.</li>
<li>The Velcro theory of memory - the more hooks, the better</li>
<li>Sour grapes - the best explanation of cognitive dissonance. From Aesops ancient fable, The Fox and the Grapes</li>
</ul>


<h3>Credibility</h3>


<ul>
<li>Showing convincing evidence. If you believe that h.pylori bacteria causes ulcers, then drink a solution full of them and see what the result is!
This may not be sensible, but the result is convincing. One way or the other.</li>
<li>Having external credibility. As a doctor, your medical advice would be credible.
But, the smoker with lung cancer also gains credibility through their experience of making the wrong decisions.
Or how about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/business/how-a-financial-pro-lost-his-house.html?pagewanted=all">Financial Pro Who Lost his House</a>, he has both types of external credibility!</li>
<li>Minor, quirky details make a story more believable, as well as more memorable.</li>
<li>To show competence - use examples that pass the Sinatra Test: If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere</li>
<li>Make your claim easy for people to verify. The logic doesnt have to be perfect. "Wheres the beef?",leads people to judge a burger by the amount of beef in it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Emotionality</h3>


<ul>
<li>If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will act. We are easily overwhelmed; keep things simple, and on a scale we can hope to tackle.
Ask for donations to a single child, or village, in a starving nation, not to solve the entire problem.</li>
<li>Appeal to self-interest. But, the noble forms of self-interest are the most powerful, self-actualization and so forth.
We all have needs described by Maslows hierarchy, but in fact we tackle them all simultaneously.</li>
<li><p>"They laughed when I sat down to play the piano. But when I began to play" = one of the most successful marketing slogans of all time. Its aspirational.</p></li>
<li><p>Appeal to Identity. How to stop macho Texans from littering? The message:Dont mess with Texas! , delivered by Texan sport stars.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Why should we want to use stories? Well, firstly, for inspiration: if we see that Jared (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle">Subway fame</a>) was able to lose so much weight, we feel our problems should be easy to solve.
 And, to give guidance as how to act; particular cautionary tales will stick in our minds so we dont make the same mistakes.</p>

<p>It is a good book. I dont have too many quibbles. The main criticism would be that none of the advice is that surprising.
But, it does do a good job of identifying important issues and showing how often we fail to address them. And, the book mostly tries to follow its own advice, which is reassuring.
This book is a useful pointer in the right direction. It makes sense that pairing stories with ideas will make for much more effective communication. Indeed, it seems to unify a lot of ideas about good exposition that I had started to identify through experience.</p>
