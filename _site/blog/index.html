				<h2><a href="/blog//2015/05/19/Infrastructure-As-Code-Is-Not-Configuration-Management">Infrastructure as Code is not Configuration Management</a></h2>
				<p><p>For the past few months, I have been concerned with deploying complex applications from the ground up on top of my company's IaaS platform, Interoute VDC. Wanting not to re-invent the wheel , we have spent quite some time looking at tools that could do the job. In this search I somewhere came across the sentiment that forms the title of this piece, and for some time, I was quite confused about this [1]. And it seems like lots of others are confused too. There are a plethora of plugins adding cloud provisioning capabilities to traditional Configuration Management tools such as Puppet, Chef, or Ansible. But, we eventually settled on a different solution for our provisioning: a new framework called Terraform. This is designed with IaaS specific problems in mind, which leads to some big wins, as we will see. There are three main points of differentiation:</p>

				<p><p>
Many people like to travel, myself included, and if travel has to be just one thing, it is adventure. Most people would agree that travel is a type of adventure. But, how is it adventurous? We all have googles, tripadvisors and lonely planets falling out of our eyeballs. We know in advance exactly what we want to do and when we want to do it. Is that really adventure? On the other hand, if we take a trip that is unstructured and unplanned, we tend not to stumble across those amazing things we were hoping to find (although perhaps sometimes we do). So, where is the adventure to be found?

				<h2><a href="/blog//2015/01/03/New-Years-Substitutions">New Years' Substitutions</a></h2>
				<p><p>
As I have been learning a lot about psychology this year, I thought to make some changes to my New Years' Resolutions. Specifically, for the bad habits I want to cut down on, I will now rely on <em>substitution</em>.
</p>
<p>
Substitution, as a strategy for habit change, is based on a psychological theory of behaviours. The first thing this says that the behaviour can be broken down into a trigger, a routine and a reward:
<ul>
	<li>The <em>trigger</em> includes both the context and the specific prompt for the behaviour</li>
	<li>The <em>routine</em> describes the sequence of physical actions and the though processes being carried out in the behaviour</li>
	<li>The <em>reward</em> specifies which results of the behaviour stimulate any of the various reward centres of the brain [1]</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
What does Hedonism mean to you? Perhaps the first things that come to mind will be sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Or indeed, money, hoes and dro. This is surely a hedonistic way of living life. But is this, in fact, everything that hedonism can mean, and is hedonism an immature and irresponsible way to live life - suited best to rockstars and other self-destructive types?

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/12/07/House-Prices-With-Repeat-Sales-Regression">Repeat Sales means House Prices</a></h2>
				<p><p>
There is a problem with the way houses are traded. Since houses are so heterogeneous, it is hard to estimate what they are worth according to any consistent methodology - and it is hard to place them into a trend. If I look at a stock, for example, it is frequently traded so I know that the price I would buy at reflects the market value. The history of its price growth is available and hence we have some clues as to whether this value seems to reflect an underconfident or alternatively an overinflated market (one overinflated might currently growing at 20% per year, for example). However, this is currently not the case for those looking to buy a house - the asking price is the single price point available, and whether it is market value can normally be only determined by the level of interest, by ad hoc comparisons, or by an expensive valuation process. We need a method to be able to value houses on a local basis, whilst taking into account their heterogeneous nature.

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/11/02/Everyone-Is-An-Artist">Everyone Is An Artist</a></h2>
				<p><p>"Everyone is an artist". This is a highly interesting quote. Because, on the face of it, it is clearly untrue. Not everyone is a painter, not everyone is a sculptor, nor is everyone a draughtsman. In fact, most people are none of these things. But, although these are extremely important as mediums, these are not pre-requisites for art. Art, in its purest form, is about the expression of the intangible aspects of the world we live in. This is what is really interesting -  what is seen by one person cannot ordinarily be seen by anyone else. You may capture an image, but it is rather more difficult to capture a subjective experience.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/08/14/Why-We-Spend-Expenses-Wrongly">Why We Spend Expenses Wrongly</a></h2>
				<p><p>My company, like many others, provides a fixed daily amount to recompense travellers for their daily expenses. On most occasions this ends up being a little more than your expenses naturally sum to. Now, in theory, this means that once you know the duration of that trip (and assuming you trust payroll) you are sure to receive a fixed amount of money. However, people do not quite react accordingly. In particular, there is a tendency to fixate on the daily amount to guide decision-making. When I have been with my colleagues to dinner, we tend to spend more when expenses are being paid than when they are not. People want to spend the allowance - and when they spend the allowance, they stop spending.</p>

<p>According to rational economic theory, this makes no sense at all. The daily allowance has no relevance to your spending - you should spend as you normally would for dinner. Simply, you just buy according to your preferences. However, prospect theory comes in to play to explain this behaviour, as follows.</p>

<p>The paradigm conceives of two actors: a client and a server. The client sends a request to the server, of a particular type, and with certain parameters. In reply the server returns a response message. The response message includes a status code in the header - giving information about the requested information, and will also include a body which is the content at the requested URI. Lets look at the process in more detail.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/07/05/A-Friendly-FAQ-For-Unit-Testing">A Friendly FAQ For Unit Testing</a></h2>
				<p><h3>The Basics</h3>


<p>Unit testing, in its modern form, is the process of writing automated test scripts that run against your units of code. This is usually tied together with OO programming practices, but also can be applied elsewhere. The benefits are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lowers chance of regression in the codebase. This in turn encourages (enables!) refactoring</li>
    <li>Shortens the feedback loop; problems are found earlier</li>
    <li>Is a precise documentation of the system, and the intent of pieces of code</li>
    <li>Encourages good design; it makes you think about the coupling and interfaces of the design</li>
</ul>


<p>The form of the test is usually quite simple - you will have:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A method to set up resources than can be used by all tests</li>
    <li>A method to initialize before every test common dependencies/common state</li>
    <li>The test method itself - which includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Initialization of state and dependencies that are specific to that test method</li>
            <li>Call to the method under test</li>
            <li>Assertions of the expected state that is produced by the test method</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Test-specific cleanup</li>
    <li>Cleanup of shared resources after all tests have run</li>
</ol>


<p>Tests will pass when the assertions all return true, and no exceptions are encountered during the test execution. Otherwise, the test will fail.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/06/07/OCJP6-How-And-Wherefore">Becoming a Certified Java Person</a></h2>
				<p><p>Last weekend, I became an Oracle Certified Java Professional. It took some efforts to prepare for this exam, but in the end I was able to pass with flying colours. So, I thought this would be a good time to share some tips on preparing for the exam - and what you might hope to get from that work beyond a certificate.</p>

<p>First off, I have to say, this is not an easy exam. I do not work with Java every day, but I have been using it sporadically and in my own projects for more than two years. Still, it took me a month of hard (albeit part-time) study including a week of heavy cramming to be really well-versed on all the material. Part of the reason for this is that, as a user of the language, you are not necessarily aware of all the different possibilities; once you find some patterns that work you can just re-use them without knowing about all the other options that the language provides for you.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/04/07/Seven-A-Day">Seven-A-Day</a></h2>
				<p><p>According to a new study that has been doing the rounds in the news, the traditional 5-a-day doesn't really cut it and we should be eating 7 portions of fruit or veg every day. What's more, the majority of those portions should be vegetables rather than fruit. For a non-vegetable eating person like me, this certainly seems like a lot. But, the health and lifestyle benefits are scientifically proven, and we should all listen more to solid science. Some of the benefits of eating more fruit and vegetables are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lowering the risk over obesity/type 2 diabetes as vegetables are filling and not high in calories</li>
<li>Lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and some cancer</li>
<li>Keep you healthy and energised with vital vitamins and nutrients you need</li>
</ul>


<p>I certainly want to get on board with each of these benefits. But, I have a "pragmatic" approach to food - if it is quick, and tasty, that's what I tend to go for. And, I know many people are in the same boat with me. So, we will have to devise some kinds of strategies to get us eating more healthily - and being more healthy.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2014/02/28/Electric-Dreams-Or-Electric-Relaxation">Electric Dreams or Electric Relaxation?</a></h2>
				<p><p>I've been thinking a little recently about the electric car market. I tend get very excited about the prospect of electric cars taking over our streets (despite the fact that I very rarely need to drive, at the moment). I like the technology, and I like what they stand for. Eco-friendly. Intense acceleration and low centres of mass. This means guilt-free driving pleasure. But, sometimes it seems unclear whether what technical underpinnings lie under this sea change towards electric propulsion (if indeed it is so). And it has seemed obvious until now that the Tesla cars are the stars of the show in regards to electric transportation. These are by far and away the most exciting cars; they get far more hype and they get far more praise than any other electric car on the market. But why? What is really the state of the art and where does it reside? And most importantly, how long will it be until I own my own electric sportscar?</p>

<p>This is a story that can be illustrated with two simple graphics.</p>

				<p><p>C-K ("Concept-Knowledge") theory is a popular and successful model to describe and give insight to the process of design. At its heart, it posits a distinction between the space of knowledge and the space of concepts, and it builds upon this to describe the process of design as a sequence of operations that transform knowledge into concepts, and vice versa.</p>

<p>We may seek to understand it in order to achieve a more structured methodical approach to design, and also to see how the creative design process is unified with the discipline of problem-solving, which might perhaps be considered more scientific in nature.</p>

No matter how early I tried to start, there was never quite enough time before exams to learn everything as well as I had been used to. I have a perfectionist streak, so this left a feeling of having left things unfinished with me. And I spent some effort in trying to think of how I can avoid this. After having tried out a number of different productivity systems, not entirely successfully, I decided that I needed to learn much more about the underlying psychology behind concentration and studying. And, it turns out that there are a number of fairly simple psychological principles that can help you in forming effective working habits.</p>

<h3>Willpower is a limited resource</h3>


<p>There is a psychological phenomenon called 'ego depletion', in which subjects who had needed to exert willpower in a task performed more poorly in a subsequent cognitively demanding test [1]. Since maintaining concentration on a task usually takes some willpower[2], this suggests that maximising the amount of time you spend in work is not always the best way to get the most done. Interestingly, exerting willpower or engaging in heavy cognition lowers blood glucose level, and it has been found that ingestion of glucose helps to counteract the effect of ego
depletion.That is, a low level of glucose is to be avoided. It is for this reason that I always used to take energy drinks with me to a study session, and, when I was looking at other students around the library, I saw that I was not the only one to have picked up this habit.</p>

				<h2><a href="/blog//2011/10/10/When-I-Saw-This-Book-I-Laughed">When I saw this book I laughed. But when I started to read...</a></h2>
				<p><p>"Made to stick" is a book about sticky ideas. It seems most relevant to marketers. But, the message that it conveys would be useful to anyone. Its all about story-telling, and who doesnt need to tell stories?<br/>
The authors advice: in order to communicate a message for maximum recall, we should not rely on facts or figures, but should instead tell stories. Even if not telling a story, we should include some story-like aspects, which are identified as the following:</p>

<h3>Simplicity - finding the core of the message. And making it compact.</h3>


<ul>
<li>"Its the economy, stupid" = What you remember from Bill Clintons presidential campaign. Even if you didnt see the campaign.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Unexpectedness</h3>


<ul>
<li>Get attention by breaking a pattern. Were good at recognising patterns, and dealing with them without giving them much attention. Break this system!</li>
<li>Create mystery; highlight a knowledge gap.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Concreteness - Minimise abstraction in factor of examples</h3>


<ul>
<li>Dont fall prey to the curse of knowledge. A successful story will naturally be an over-simplification. But people can only learn things one at a time.
The abstractions that an expert can deduce from experience will not be meaningful to someone without those experiences.</li>
<li>The Velcro theory of memory - the more hooks, the better</li>
<li>Sour grapes - the best explanation of cognitive dissonance. From Aesops ancient fable, The Fox and the Grapes</li>
</ul>


<h3>Credibility</h3>


<ul>
<li>Showing convincing evidence. If you believe that h.pylori bacteria causes ulcers, then drink a solution full of them and see what the result is!
This may not be sensible, but the result is convincing. One way or the other.</li>
<li>Having external credibility. As a doctor, your medical advice would be credible.
But, the smoker with lung cancer also gains credibility through their experience of making the wrong decisions.
Or how about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/business/how-a-financial-pro-lost-his-house.html?pagewanted=all">Financial Pro Who Lost his House</a>, he has both types of external credibility!</li>
<li>Minor, quirky details make a story more believable, as well as more memorable.</li>
<li>To show competence - use examples that pass the Sinatra Test: If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere</li>
<li>Make your claim easy for people to verify. The logic doesnt have to be perfect. "Wheres the beef?",leads people to judge a burger by the amount of beef in it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Emotionality</h3>


<ul>
<li>If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will act. We are easily overwhelmed; keep things simple, and on a scale we can hope to tackle.
Ask for donations to a single child, or village, in a starving nation, not to solve the entire problem.</li>
<li>Appeal to self-interest. But, the noble forms of self-interest are the most powerful, self-actualization and so forth.
We all have needs described by Maslows hierarchy, but in fact we tackle them all simultaneously.</li>
<li><p>"They laughed when I sat down to play the piano. But when I began to play" = one of the most successful marketing slogans of all time. Its aspirational.</p></li>
<li><p>Appeal to Identity. How to stop macho Texans from littering? The message:Dont mess with Texas! , delivered by Texan sport stars.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Why should we want to use stories? Well, firstly, for inspiration: if we see that Jared (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle">Subway fame</a>) was able to lose so much weight, we feel our problems should be easy to solve.
 And, to give guidance as how to act; particular cautionary tales will stick in our minds so we dont make the same mistakes.</p>

<p>It is a good book. I dont have too many quibbles. The main criticism would be that none of the advice is that surprising.
But, it does do a good job of identifying important issues and showing how often we fail to address them. And, the book mostly tries to follow its own advice, which is reassuring.
This book is a useful pointer in the right direction. It makes sense that pairing stories with ideas will make for much more effective communication. Indeed, it seems to unify a lot of ideas about good exposition that I had started to identify through experience.</p>
