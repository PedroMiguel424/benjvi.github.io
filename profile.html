				<p>I'm Ben. I'm a 26 year old software developer and former physicist. I like understanding how things work and making new things.</p>
				
				<p>My primary interest is in using technology to improve decision-making in everyday life. This forms the underlying theme for my writing which covers psychological fact-findings, musings and software engineering posts.<p>

				<p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen you might be able to catch me meditating, on the road, running, painting or doing some dancing.</p>
