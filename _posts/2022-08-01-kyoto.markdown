Arriving in Kyoto from Tokyo on the bullet train, as soon as you step out of the station it's very much clear that one has left the centre of the action.

Kyoto is a much smaller and less bustling city. It's actually only the 8th or 9th biggest in Japan. However, as it was the capital for *a thousand years* until the 19th century, it has some of the most striking cultural sites.

Ranking sites by those with the most striking appearance, the Golden Panilion *Kinkaku-ji* has to be at the top of the list.

It's a Zen temple covered in gold leaf, situated in a harmonious Zen garden. It's also the most visited attraction in Kyoto, which undercuts the peacefulness a little.

In many ways, I enjoyed the sister temple *Ginkaku-ji* (the silver pavilion) more.

It's much less busy (although still somewhat popular). As such you can appreciate its understated elegance a bit better. Contemplating the meticulously cared-for garden, you might find that other thoughts start to fade away.

That is to say, there's something of the meaning of Zen that can be experienced here.

The sand and rock garden held particular appeal for me. These are intended to reproduce the world in miniature, and in abstract. By evoking the natural world, these gardens aim to incite meditation in the viewer.

A particularly good example of a zen rock garden is to be found at nearby temple *Ryoan-ji*. This was another visit I enjoyed enormously.

There's something about the arrangement here that particularly seems to draw the attention in but at the same time resist any interpretation you try to impose onto it.

Rounding out my trip of Buddhist templates, we come to *Kiyomizu-dera*. 

![](/img/japan/kansai/11-kiyomizudera-entrance.webp)

It's one of the biggest and most important temples in Kyoto, famous for its wooden terrace.

![](/img/japan/kansai/12-kiyomizudera-terrace.webp)

It's also one of the oldest temples, pre-dating the rise of Zen in Japan by centuries.

The temple grounds also incorporate Shinto sites - head to the Kishu shrine and the Otowa waterfall, whose sacred water can be drunk.

This is said to impart good fortune.

Nearby is the *Fushimi Inari* shrine, famous for its thousands of red *torii* gates.

![](/img/japan/kansai/15-torii-gates-entrance.webp)

It's quite the experience to walk through this path of never-ending gates.

These types of gates - found at temples -are said to mark the passage from the mundane outside to the sacred. Here in Kyoto, it became a custom to donate these gates to express gratitude to the temple. Over hundreds of years, these donations have resulted in these paths toward the temple being lined with hundreds of gates, celebrating the sacredness of the temple and the ritual of entering it.

Outside of the cultural sites, it was a joy to wander around the traditional neighbourhood of Gion (which was also where my hostel was).

The wooden townhouses are very evocative, seeming to suggest the customs and lifestyle of times past.

On the edge of town, the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest is another nostalgic spot. The forest - whilst not as big as you might expect - has its own air of mystery and romance.

Beyond Kyoto, the rest of the Kansai region has a lot to offer. 

![](/img/japan/kansai/18-nara-town.webp)

The town of Nara, an hour north of Kyoto on a local train, is also home to a grand historical Buddhist temple. *Todai-ji* dates from a similar era to *Kiyomizu-dera* in Kyoto, and is similarly important.

It also has a unique additional charm in the form of hundreds of tame deer that walk the grounds of the temple.

I also stayed briefly in Osaka - which is a much bigger city than Nara or Kyoto. It's lively and bustling, and I found the people to be exceptionally hospitable. 

The stand-out cultural site is the resplendent Osaka Castle:

Even from there, you cannot get away from the modernity of the city:

![](/img/japan/kansai/22-osaka-pano-1.webp)

The food is also a highlight. The *okonomiyaki* that I mentioned in my previous post about Tokyo is actually native to Osaka. Other great Osakan dishes include *takoyaki* (deep-fried octopus balls) and *udon* noodles.

![](/img/japan/kansai/22.5-takoyaki.webp)

In general, it seems like food in Osaka & the Kansai region is particularly hearty and comfortable - it is sometimes aptly described as Japan's soul food. I also remember eating more bar-style food - things like Teriyaki skewers - although my perspective may have been biased by the time I spent meeting up with some Japanese university friends in the *Izakaya* (Japanese pub).

All in all, the Kansai region has a lot to offer and I was glad I got to see quite a few different facets of Japanese life outside of Tokyo.

Next, my trip would take me on a multi-stage journey to my next destination: first, back to Tokyo on the Shinkansen, then, flying back to Kuala Lumpur, before finally flying out again to my destination of Cambodia.
