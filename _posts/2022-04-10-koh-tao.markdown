After my trip to Bangkok, I had taken the train down as far as Chumphon, which dropped me off in the early morning. The next step of the journey was to take a ferry across from the port at Chumphon, to the tropical island of Koh Tao.

This was the main activity I'd planned out for this journey. My plan was to learn to dive on the island, and use that as an opportunity to also do a bit of "voluntourism", using my *as-yet-to-be-developed* diving skills to help out with schemes for coral regeneration, hopefully generating some positive karma along the way. Although the "voluntourism" trend has gotten a bad rep, as it turned out, I was a big fan of the New Haven Dive School ran this program, which indeed offered a mix of leisure and purpose that - as a backpacker - I found very enriching.

Arriving at the main town of Sairee on the ferry, the island looked quite the tropical paradise, albeit a relatively bustling one. From there, I was picked up on a 4x4 and taken to the dive school in Chalok bay, which is a quieter area in the south of the island.

On the first day, there wasn't much to do except get checked-in to my hotel and relax on the beach underneath the palm trees.

The next day I started the Open Water diving certification which covers the basic training all divers need to do. This was a mix of theory and practice - we would do a briefing about what we were going to do that day and then go out and spend some time diving. The Open Water course was 3 days long and included either one or two dives of approximately 1 hour each day.

On the first day we stayed more in shallow waters and focused on familiarising ourselves with how to move around with the equipment and basic drills.

Later, we would do more "normal" dives, going out to dive sites to explore the reefs. We carried on repeating skills and getting more confident, maybe including one or two particular manoevers too.

Then, after the dives, there was also some theory we had to work through, in a short textbook explaining things like buoyancy and safe decompression procedures. Exploring the island, I found a cafe at a nice viewpoint from where to relax with my little bits of homework.

After the third day I moved on to do the "Advanced" certification, which is another 2 days of training which introduces additional scenarios such as deeper dives, navigation, and night dives.

In summary, I was kept reasonably busy during those days, although there was enough time to relax with a *singha* beer on the beach, or venture across to the *shark bay* where I was able to swim with black-tipped reef sharks and with one particularly memorable green sea turtle *George*. Koh Tao in fact means "Turtle Island" in Thai, and it is not for nothing! Since cameras were few and far between on my swimming trips to shark bay, I can only point you to this more recent Youtube video showing a very similar experience:

The time spent on the scuba dives was equally exciting. The ecosystem of a coral reef is like nothing else. To start with, you can focus the rich and varied colours and different structures of the different types of the coral itself.

Then pay attention to the different fishes, all have their different places to play in this world, from the "nemo fish" that hide in the sea anemones, to the pairs of bright yellow butterfly fishes serenely gliding around

Then you have the predatory and territorial triggerfish that may get aggressive if you swim too close. Better to watch them from a distance:

You may also just be swimming along and suddenly be surrounded by a shoal of barracuda:

That's not to mention, if you look closer into the surfaces, you may be able to find one of any number of colourful [nudibranches](https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/what-nudibranch-meet-high-fashion-models-ocean-depths). Or, if you look around underneath the reef long enough, you might come across a moray eel (unfortunately not captured on photo). I personally had many encounters with the delightfully exotic pufferfishes that puff up when they're under threat. But [don't be tempted to puff them up!](https://scubadiverlife.com/stop-puffing-pufferfish/)

On the second week, it was just more of the same! I spent some of the time helping to build the coral nurseries, and some more time out exploring the reef as well.

It was a very easy routine to get used to. Outside of the water, I kept myself powered (/ indulged myself) with different types of Thai curries, soups, and, above all, many Pad Thai noodle dishes. Although I was there on a solo journey, my fellow divers and everyone who I met was very friendly so there was rarely a lonely moment.

*Overall*, this dive program was a really nice way to spend time, and kindled in me a love for diving. Over the years since, although chances to dive are admittedly not so common, I keep being drawn back to diving.

After two weeks though, my planned time was up, and my adventure was to continue south into Malaysia.
