*Continued from [Part 1]({{site.url}}/2021/09/11/honduras-trip-1) ...*

Having exhausted our time in Roatan, we set off in the morning on the ferry back to the mainland. On arrival back in La Ceiba, and being reunited with our trusty Toyota Corolla, we stop off on the road out of the city at a Dunkin Donuts for breakfast. Ordinarily, I would not consider this to be noteworthy, but the Dunkin Donuts in Honduras uses 100% locally produced coffee. And its really the good stuff, nothing like the mediocrity I've drunk in other Dunkin Donuts. A perk of being in a coffee producing country.

On the way to La Ceiba from Tegucigalpa, we had driven along the main road to El Progreso and then took the coast road towards our hotel in La Ceiba:

Now we're headed to Copan, which is to the west of the country, by the border with Guatemala. So we will need to return first to El Progreso, then continue via San Pedro Sula towards the town of Copan Ruinas, with the final destination again being our hotel in the centre of town:

Our first stop is for lunch in El Progreso, in the "Mega Plaza" mall (marked as Hub Progreso on the map). As in many other tropical countries, malls seem to be the preferred place to hang out in Honduras, being a safe and convenient space to escape from the heat. For my taste, they do suffer a little from an excessive influence of USA-based brands. In the food courts in particular, the food in those typical chains is the same as in many other malls around the world - a bit boring. Fortunately, in most malls you can find some chains selling local food too.

On departure from El Progreso, we pass through Honduras' second city, San Pedro Sula. Aside from an (inadvisable) wrong turn taking us through *Calle 10* in the peripheral neighbourhood *Colonia Sat√©lite*, we stay on the ringroad, and so I didn't see the city centre at all. From what I understand, San Pedro Sula is more of a commercial and industrial centre and has less to offer for tourist activities. Maybe I will get the chance to get to know it myself one day, in the meantime I enjoyed experiencing it vicariously in this (Spanish-language) Youtube video:

From San Pedro Sula, we continue along the long road to the town of Copan Ruinas. Copan is famous for being a large Mayan settlement - one of the few places in the world where large Mayan pyramids and stelae still survive. It is somewhat confusing that the town itself is called "Copan Ruinas", while the archaelogical site is referred to just as "Copan".

We don't have time to see it today though, after a long day of driving we arrive at our hotel late at night. I have to rely entirely on my partner for the checkin as the receptionist doesn't speak English, and then we hit the hay. We need the rest because there will be a lot of things to do tomorrow.

We start the day with a traditional breakfast. This is made up of similar ingredients to baleadas, except the *queso seco* (a dry salty cheese) can swapped for softer *queso fresco* or *cuajada*. The fried plantain here is unmissable.

After breakfast we head down to the archaelogical site, just a few minutes from town. Upon entering the site itself, the first thing we notice is a little habitat for *Guacamayas* (a type of parrot and the national bird of Honduras):

In general, the park is big, spacious and well-kept. But its difficult to escape the feeling that the jungle is about to swallow up the ruins.

The Mayan culture remains somewhat mysterious. These pyramids and structures, once part of a great Mayan city, is one of the few places to experience the real legacy of the Mayans today.

In Latin America, where much of the legacy of the native cultures has been lost following the conquista and its associated plagues, these sites are particularly important. This view appears on the one *lempira* note:

Happily, modern scholarship has been able to decode the Mayan glyphs and make sense of much of the stelae and other relics at Copan. I have enjoyed learning more about this heritage in the books of Michael D. Coe.

</div>

Many of the pyramids also contain chambers inside, which unfortunately are not safe to visit. However, there is a complete replica of the temple inside one of the larger pyramids:

Although there's a lot to explore, you can make your way through the archaelogical site in half a day. So, somewhere around lunchtime, we return to the town of Copan Ruinas and head over to a Coffee plantation. Over there, we combine a tour of the plantation with a hearty lunch of traditional food (rice, beans, cheese and *chicharron* pork):

Its really crazy to think that brown powder used to prepare our everyday drinks starts as red cherries in the forest, and that so much work and care goes into preparing them for us.

After the tour finishes, and we try some of the delicious coffee, we return to the town of Copan Ruinas to dine and spend the evening relaxing. I didn't capture any photos of the town itself, which is a shame, as it's a charming little place with colonial-style architecture.

Our visit to Copan was short but sweet! Tomorrow we will be travelling again back on the road to Tegucigalpa - that will come in [part 3]({{site.url}}/2022/03/14/honduras-trip-3) ...
