I arrived in Tokyo at the start of April. It was a big change, coming from the tropical climes of Malaysia to the temperate spring of Japan.

It's a nice time to visit. A special benefit of visiting during spring is enjoying the spectacle of the cherry blossoms.

There are many places around the world where you can enjoy this natural marvel, but nowhere is it as big as in Japan. Cherry blossom trees are everywhere.

It's also part of the culture and has its own associated traditions. Whilst the trees are blossoming, everyone comes out to meet, hang out and have a good time under the cherry blossom. Drinking is also an important part of the fun - something I can easily understand as a Brit.

There are a lot of other traditions to enjoy in Tokyo.

Japan has a long history as a monarchy, and as such has a grand *Imperial Palace* for its monarch, covering an enormous swathe of land in central Tokyo.

What it is not is particularly photogenic. The appeal seems to be in its mystique and harmonious environment rather than the scale of the buildings. Furthermore, since it's still the household of the emperor, there's not so much you can see of it.

As an imperial power, of course, it has large museums full of beautiful artefacts to show off. I visited the Tokyo National Museum, which did indeed have an impressive collection.

Japan also has its own distinct religious traditions. Zen Buddism is practised, but it is fused with the native Shinto religion, which has more animistic ideas - worshipping spirits that are connected to aspects of the natural world. Temples and shrines are well-cared for - which should not be a surprise as most Japanese people still participate in religious traditions and practices.

I visited the Sensoji temple in the Asakusa district. This is the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Visitors to the temple first pass through the grand and ceremonious Hozomon gate.

I also visited the Meiji Shrine, whose entrance was pictured in the first photo in this post. This is a Shinto shrine, dedicated to the former emperor of the same name. I was fortunate enough to see a traditional wedding being celebrated while I was there.

In food, as well, traditions are strong and valued. Only the freshest fish is good enough for Tokyo's sushi restaurants, and you can see the full range of quality produce available in Tokyo at Tsukiji fish market.

Unfortunately, since a few years back, access to certain parts of the market is now restricted, although other areas are still possible to visit. 

Of course, Japanese food is not limited only to sushi, there's a lot of other things you should try.

A lesser-known Japanese dish that has since become a firm favourite in my house is Okonomiyaki. It's something like a fried pancake, or rosti, but made with cabbage. Here's one of mine:

Apart from the traditional, the other side of Tokyo is the modern. There's the shopping area of Shibuya, typified by the iconic scramble crossing.

Everything is tuned up to 11. They even have speakers outside playing the sort of upbeat pop that shops love to play to energize shoppers. At the time *Starships* by Nicki Minaj was playing on repeat all day long.

*Lost in Translation* is a great film in which this area features prominently, heavily leaning into the sense of cultural dislocation that a foreigner feels in Japan.

A lot of the other scenes are based in Shinjuku, an area which has a bit of everything and gives perhaps the most typical image of Tokyo. Shopping, business, nightlife - everything can be found there. This was also where my hostel was located, and I would definitely recommend it as an area to stay in.

Other lively areas worth visiting are the fashion-forward Harajuku, and the centre of Japanese geek culture, Akihabara.

My final experience of Japanese modernity in Tokyo was the *Shinkansen* - the Japanese bullet train - that I took to leave Tokyo, the current capital, headed for the former capital, Kyoto.
