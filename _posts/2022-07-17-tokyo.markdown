I arrived in Tokyo at the start of April. It was a big change, coming from the tropical climes of Malaysia, to the temperate spring of Japan.

It's a nice time to visit. A special benefit of visiting during spring is to enjoy the spectable of the cherry blossoms.

There's many places around the world where you can enjoy this natural marvel, but nowhere is it as big as in Japan. Cherry blossom trees are everywhere.

It's also part of the culture and has its own associated traditions. Whilst the trees are blossoming, everyone comes out to meet, hang out and have a good time under the cherry blossom. Drink is also important - something I can understand as a Brit.

There's a lot of other ttraditions to enjoy in Tokyo.

Japan has a long history as a monarchy, and as such has a grand Imperial Palace for its monarch, covering an enormous swathe of land in central Tokyo.

What it is not is particularly photogenic. The appeal seems to be in its mystique and harmonious environment rather than the scale of the buildings. Furthermore, since its still the household of the emperor, there's not so much you can see of it.

As an imperial power, of course it has large museums full of beautiful artifacts to show off. I visited the Tokyo National museum, which did indeed have an impressive collection.

Japan also has its own distinct religious traditions. Zen Buddism is practiced, but it is fused with the native Shinto religion, which has more animistic ideas. Temples and shrines are well-cared for - which should not be a surprised as most Japanese people still participate in religious traditions and practices.

In food, as well, traditions are strong and valued. Only the freshest fish is good enough for Tokyo's sushi restaurants, and you can see the range of produce available at Tsukiji fish market.

Unfortunately, since a few years back, access to certain parts of the market is now restricted, although other areas are still possible to visit.

Of course, Japanese food is not limited only to sushi.

A lesser-known Japanese dish that has since become a firm favourite in my house is Okonomiyaki. It's something like a fried pancake, or rosti, but made with cabbage. Here's one of mine:

Apart from the traditional, the other side of Tokyo is the modern. There's the shopping area of Shibuya, typified by the iconic scramble crossing.

Everything is tuned up to 11. They even have speakers outside playing the sort of upbeat pop that shops love to play to energize shoppers. At the time *Starships* by Nicki Minaj was playing on repeat all day long.

*Lost in Translation* is a great film set in this area, heavily leaning into the sense of cultural dislocation that a foreigner feels in Japan.

Other lively areas worth visiting are the fashion forward Harajuku, and the centre of Japanese geek culture, Akihabara.

My final experience of Japanese modernity in Tokyo was the *Shinkansen* - the Japanese bullet train - that I took to leave Tokyo, the current capital, headed for the former capital, Kyoto.
