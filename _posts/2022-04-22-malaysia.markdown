After finishing [my diving fun in Koh Tao](/2022/04/10/koh-tao), my journey continued south into Malaysia.

After an interesting overnight ferry ride, through a lightning storm, down to Surat Thani, I eventually found myself a bus transfer down to the border. All of this was a very surreal, dream-like experience, although now I only remember it very hazily. From there, my bus journey continued to the first port of call in Georgetown, on the island of Penang.

Now, the city does have a lot to offer. But, for me, what made this destination truly memorable was the food. Above all, for me, Malaysia is a foodie heaven. I would be quite happy to just wander through the streets, in the humid heat, just going from meal to meal all day long.

Malaysian food is an intriguing mix of different tastes and influences. The main influences being from the large Chinese and Indian populations, along with the indigenous Malay food - which itself has some overlap with Indonesian food. All the different styles of food overlap and interwine - there's a lot of fusion.

I headed to the nearby New Line Hawker city, and was overwhelmed by the number of sellers selling different dishes. Although I had made a few Malaysian friends at uni, and tried a few things, I was really in over my head with all the different noodle dishes, soups, rice dishes and all the rest that I had no idea what it was. More difficult was that everything looked delicious, making it almost impossible to choose.

Although I have my favourite savoury Malaysian dishes, foremost amongst them *Char Kway Teow* (a fried noodle dish), perhaps the one dish that stuck out in my mind from my time in Penang was a dessert: *Cendol*. Compared to the *Ice Kachang* pictured below from later in my trip, which is a very similar dish, it has a little less shaved ice and comes slightly melted, it's a bit more of a soupy experience. It typically has more toppings than what's shown here and - crucially - worm-shaped, green, pandan-flavoured jellies.

I only spent one night in Penang, since my university friend Aaron had kindly agreed to host me in the capital, Kuala Lumpur (KL).

This was very good luck on my part, as not only did he take me to many different restaurants each day, but it also meant that I had some idea of what I was eating.

As mentioned, my single favorite food is probably the *Char Kway Teow* (pictured) - rice noodles, stir-fried with egg and lots of other stuff. This is also a typical Hawker scene in KL. It seemed to be less common that all the hawkers are out in the street, like in Bangkok, and more common to have stalls in a centre like this - a more controlled, sanitised environment. It's not *as* iconic, but I found that these centres have the same bustling vibe and local charm.

For fried noodle dishes, *Hokkien Mee* or *Mee Goreng* are also popular and delicious options. Depending on where exactly you eat them, you might find either being prepared in very different ways.

The noodle soups are also delicious. Pictured here is a delicious noodle soup - which I think is called *Pan Mee*.

When it comes to noodle soups, the *Laksa* reigns supreme. Or, I should say, the Laksas, because there are many different types available. Laksas are a kind of fusion of South-East asian curries with Chinese noodle soup. The most popular, and also my go-to, was the *curry laksa* which is has a red curry and coconut broth. It can contain many different ingredeients, but the most common are tofu, shrimps and beansprouts.

After a day or two of mostly just stuffing myself with food, I thought that I should do some sightseeing too. I found it hard to ascertain the centre of gravity of KL, but my best guess as the centre is the area around Merdeka ("independence") square, with its ginormous Malaysian flag. It's a pleasing mix of old and new, in the midst of skyscrapers but with many traditional buildings around. The Neo-Moorish or Mughal architectural styles seemed to be common amongst those more traditional buildings.

After some time walking around outside, you need to escape from the sweltering heat. For that reason there are many many malls around the city. Despite being icy cold inside, the mall is also a great place to eat - despite the bad rep mall food has in other places.

So what else is unmissable and omnipresent? First and foremost, that has to be *Nasi Lemak*, the prototypical Malay food, and the national dish. It's a rice dish, served with a *Sambal* spicy paste, boiled egg, *Ikan Bilis* (fried dried anchovies), and roasted peanuts. I always had them with a *Rendang* curry on the side, which is another delicious dish in itself. Other versions come with fried chicken, and could be with many other things.

More simply, you can have a *Roti Canai*, an Indian-derived dish consisting of a paratha-style flatbread with a curry sauce. Can look rather basic but one of my faves.

There's also a whole range of Indian restaurants and hawkers around, where you can have access to other deliciousness - such as a banana leaf platter, or in fact, the whole gamut of Indian dishes.

For that matter, we didn't scratch the surface of the Chinese food available either, but that's perhaps a topic best saved for another time. I will just mention my favourite typical Malaysian Chinese dish, *Hainanese Chicken Rice*, which looks very plain but is delicious, being slow-cooked in a broth that's then served on the chicken and rice.

Finally, the topic of desserts. As a tropical country, tropical fruits abound - mango, guava, dragonfruit, rambutan, starfruit. All make for delicious options in a dessert. But the standout Malaysian fruit - that you have to try *at least once* - is the infamous *durian*. Because of its overwhelming odour, this can be an intimidating proposition. I found that durian-flavoured ice cream was a gentle introduction to the strong aromatics of the fruit. It has to be said, it's not for everyone, but I loved it!

Despite being lost in this food paradise, the travel continued. I visited the beautiful Batu Caves just outside KL, which are an important Hindu sacred site. It's also a little hectic!

And Singapore is only a few hours down South, and definitely well worth a short visit. It's not a backpacker-style place - too developed and not with any standout tourist attractions - but I had fun wandering around and appreciating the set pieces of the city.

Cuisine-wise, things are not much different than in Malaysia. Accordingly, I had a great time at the Chinatown Street (night) Market around the corner from my hostel.

Around the next corner was a similarly enjoyable hawker centre, just up the street from this beautifully ornate Hindu temple:

I only passed a couple of days in Singapore, which was enough to enjoy the city.

After that, I returned to my home base of KL. In fact, KL would be my home base throughout my backpacking trip, as it's a hub for low-cost flights. 

It worked great as a hub, as I was always returning to delicious food and friendly faces.

In any case, I took advantage of those low-cost flights to fly out to my next destination, the furthest I would go on this trip - the land of the rising sun, Japan.
