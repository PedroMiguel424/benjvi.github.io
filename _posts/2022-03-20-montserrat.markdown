It's a beautiful day trip from Barcelona, well worth the visit. A unique place in the Catalan countryside, and a really nice place to go hiking, with quite a few different trails. Some of the logistics do look like a bit of a mystery online, but it's actually a very easy day trip to make. ‚õ∞Ô∏èüö†üåû

# Getting There

To get to Montserrat, you have to use the R5 suburban train line, which we took from Plaza Espa√±a.

There can be a gap of up to an hour between trains, so we checked the timetables before leaving home. Since we're a little far from Plaza Espana, we left early, arriving with some 20 minutes to spare to buy tickets. Plaza Espa√±a is a bit of a maze, so its always good to have a bit of extra time. From Plaza Espa√±a the journey took just over an hour.

There are actually two train stations you can use to get to Monserrat: *Aeri de Monserrat*, from where can you take the Cable car to get to the Monastery, and *Monistrol de Montserrat*, from where you can take the "Cremallera" (Rack Railway).

The ticket price is the same, and both routes have nice views, though not as spectacular as what's to come. While the cable car is of course more dramatic, we wanted to take our time to enjoy the views and therefore chose the rack railway. The plaza at the top is a good spot to look down on the valley where the cable car comes up.

# The Monastery

The monastery buildings themselves were pleasant to wander around for a few minutes, although we did not linger there. As in many of the hillside towns in Catalonia, there is a lot of history and significance to the place.

# The Hike

If you ask at the information desk by the exit of the rack railway at the monastery, you can get a map with five hiking routes shown. We took the route towards Sant Jeroni. From there, you can continue to the highest point of montserrat. The hike starts off with the steepest section, before flattening out a little as you hike up through the foliage in the higher sections of the valley.

Once you get to the hermitage of Sant Jeroni itself, the path becomes less covered and you see more and more rock outcrops.

As you get to the summit, you start to see better and better panoramic views of the surrounding countryside:

We took the route in the reverse direction to normal, which meant we walked all the way up from the monastery, and then walked back toward the funicular, which we would ride for the descent. I find this way, hiking up to the summit the most satisfying way to do a walk, although the route from the upper funicular station to the summit would certainly be satisfying in itself.

We took some breaks, and spent quite some time at the top to enjoy it, which meant that this hike was a whole day out. Going at a more brisk pace, you could certainly make it in the indicated time of 2.5 to 3 hours for the entire hike there and back.

For the more serious hikers, there seem to be some additional frequented routes, which start from the main railway stations and take you the whole way to the top.

As for me, I intend to come back to try some of the other indicated routes another day.
