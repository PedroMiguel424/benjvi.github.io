*Continued from [Part 1]({{site.url}}/2021/09/11/honduras-trip-1) & [Part 2]({{site.url}}/2021/10/17/honduras-trip-pt2) ...*

To get back to Tegucigalpa from Copan Ruinas, it's a long drive through winding mountainous roads.

So once more we set off early, just after breakfast. Although the road is long, its a nice drive in the beautiful mountains:

</div>

Around lunch we make it to the small town of Gracias. We stop off at the restaurant "El Kandil". It seems to be pretty popular, and for good reason. It has a chill vibe, and nice food:

<img class="inlineimg" src="{{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/el-kandil-2.webp" style="max-width: 57%"/>
</div>

The vibe of the town itself is also rather nice - it's tranquil, with traditional colonial-style architecture. This is a typical street:

With more time, the hiking trails at Celaque national park are well worth a visit. The jungle does have a certain mystique, and the high altitude here makes for a comfortable hike:

<img class="inlineimg" src="{{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/celaque-4.webp" style="max-width: 32%"/>
</div>

The trails are extensive and even allow you to climb Honduras' tallest peak of Cerro Las Minas, if you have enough time - and enough stamina.

Since on this occasion we were short on time, we continue on the road to Tegucigalpa after lunch. We end up being in somewhat of a hurry because we have reservations at "La Cumbre" for dinner.

La Cumbre is one of the nicest fine-dining restaurants in Tegucigalpa, and a great option for a fancy date. The food is modern and tasty, and the view of the city is excellent:

Tegucigalpa has a great many restaurants, and one of the things I've enjoyed most in subsequent trips is the variety of foods available.

There are local favourites like Baleadas and Pupusas, and other traditional dishes.

</div>

These might even be accompanied by Mariachis

Hondurans also have a lot of traditional soups - one of our favourite places is "La Cacerola" (near Mall Multiplaza), where they do great soups.

<img class="inlineimg" src="{{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/cacerola-2.webp" style="max-width: 64%"/>
</div>

Even if you somehow tire of traditional food, there's also plenty of other options to enjoy, we've enjoyed a whole range of other foods including sushi, thai food, pizza & craft beer.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg - there's a big food culture in Tegucigalpa.

On the other hand, it's not an extremely touristic city. However, there are a few destinations that make an enjoyable day trip.

El Picacho is Tegucigalpa's answer to Rio's Christ The Redeemer. It's surrounded by a park which makes for a nice walk, and there were also street vendors selling tasty tamales. Since El Picacho is up on the hillside, you also get a great view of the city from here.

</div>

Further outside of the city, the town of Valle de Angeles is another destination that's popular for weekend day-trips. It's a small, pretty town filled with restaurants and shops selling artisanal goods. Perfect for exploring on a Saturday. Subsequently, we've also been to eat at the nearby town of Santa Lucia, where you can eat with a view of the traditional church and over the verdant valley.

![in santa lucia with anafre]({{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/santa-lucia-anafre.webp)

In this photo, you can also see the Anafre pot - Anafre is a very traditional dish in Honduras. It's a warm dip of beans and cheese, that you eat with tortilla chips. Delicious!

Since much of Tegucigalpa's activity has moved out of the old town and into malls and the area around Boulevard Morazan, you might tend to frequent hotels and restaurants in these areas and not automatically go to the city centre. 

![boulevard morazan 2]({{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/boulevard-morazan-2.webp)
![boulevard morazan 3]({{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/boulevard-morazan-3.webp)

However, in Tegucigalpa's old town ("El Centro"), there are a few attractions to entertain tourists. Visitors will enjoy the central park facing onto the cathedral, as well as the Museum of Art and the Old Presidential Palace.

In the latter, you can find archaeological finds from native sites around Honduras, including artifacts recovered from recently-discovered sites in La Mosquitia. There was a thriving civilization there, which persisted even after the fall of the Mayas in Copan. It completely collapsed after Europeans arrived in Honduras. Eventually, everything was swallowed by the jungle, but memories of this mysterious civilization remained in the form of various myths, such as that of a magnificent "White City" deep in the jungle.

Despite having all these options available, on this first trip, I only spent one full day in Tegucigalpa, the majority of which we spent eating and chatting.

![boulevard morazan 1]({{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/boulevard-morazan-1.webp)

And with that, all too quick, this memorable journey was over. The next day, I went back to the airport of Toncontin, this time saying my own goodbyes, before flying back to Atlanta and from there straight on to London.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 96%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

<img class="inlineimg" src="{{site.url}}/img/hn/tegus/london-aerial.webp" style="max-width: 59%"/>
</div>

Although that was the end of this journey, by no means have I covered everything Honduras has to offer. Other destinations like the colonial city of Comayagua (near to the new airport La Palmerola), the smaller (more laid-back) island of Utila, and the more remote coastal town of Trujillo (where Christopher Colombus arrived in Honduras and celebrated the first mass in America) all have their own charms and are well worth exploring.
